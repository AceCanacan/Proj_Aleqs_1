No. 6717. October 19, 1911 ] THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. FAUSTINO MESINA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N TORRES, J.: An appeal  raised by the defendant from a judgment of conviction rendered in this  case  by the Honorable Judge George N. Hurd. On the night of the 18th until the early morning of the 19th of May,  1910,  Elena Llanera was asleep in  her house situated in the pueblo of Aliaga, Nueva Ecija, her husband, Emilio Soriano, being at the time absent in this city; she was sleeping under  a mosquito netting in the parlor of the house with her three minor children and the women Damiana Collado and Elena  Molina,  and in the dining room  of the said  house the men named Cenon and Luis  Pascual,  with their respective wives, were also asleep.   At about 4 o'clock in the morning Llanera was awakened by the noise produced on the floor by a man's steps, in the  direction of her feet; she therefore awoke Damiana and,  on raising one of the sides of the mosquito  netting, they saw  and recognized Faustino Mesina, for there was then a light in the house; the latter hurriedly went into another room followed by the three women who then saw the said party go out of the window, which on that occasion was  open, and from  there alight on the ground by supporting himself upon a window of the ground floor.  The inmates of the house testified that before going to bed  that night they had  closed all the windows and doors of the house. The provincial fiscal, therefore, on September  22,  1910, filed an information with  the  Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, charging Faustino Mesina with the crime of forcible entry,  and,  this cause having been instituted, the court in view of the evidence and on  the 23d of November following rendered judgment by sentencing the defendant to the penalty of four months of arresto mayor, to pay a fine of  500  pesetas, with subsidiary  imprisonment in case  of insolvency, and the costs.   From this  judgment the defendant appealed. The facts related, duly proved in this cause, certainly constitute the crime of  forcible entry, performed without violence or intimidation, provided for and punished in article 491, paragraph 1, of the Penal Code, inasmuch as, from the testimony of three eyewitnesses, it was  fully proven  that, on the owner of the house,  Elena Llanera, being awakened, early in the morning of the 19th of  May, by the  sound  of the steps of a person who was walking inside of the house near her bed which  was covered with a mosquito netting, both she and her companions who were  sleeping  with her under the same netting on raising one side of the same saw and recognized the said person, by the light there was in the house, as being the defendant, Faustino Mesina, who, on observing that the said women had awakened and had  seen him, immediately and hastily entered  the  small room of the house, followed by them, and went down out of the building through one of the windows of the said room, which at that moment was open,  by supporting himself on  a window of the entresol, located thereunder, which must have been the way he got in, for the inmates of the house had closed that room window and  all the others in the house the  night previous before retiring. The defendant's  denial,  his exculpatory allegations and the testimony of his witnesses were unsuccessful in  overthrowing the very positive evidence  of the prosecution, for his allegation that he was at  the said house on the morning of the day aforementioned, for the purpose of  making some requests to the husband of the offended woman, Elena Llanera, who, as she was in  the granary nearby,  had  to be called and on arriving at her house  he  had  a  long conversation with  her and not  until after she  had  had her breakfast did he leave for the  sitio of Bibiclat,  was not corroborated by the testimony of his two witnesses, Buenaventura  Maligsi and  Eusebio Landicho, the first of whom testified  that he was engaged that morning in hauling rice to the warehouse of  Elena Llanera, who was then  inside of this building, and  the second  witness, that  he  was near the warehouse waiting for his neighbor named Julio; they then  saw the defendant enter the  house of  the  offended party and after a short while, during  which the latter, called by a little girl, returned to the house, these witnesses saw the defendant come down out of the house.  This testimony, far from proving the defendant's statements, completely disproves them and belies the fact affirmed by  Mesina relative to the long conversation; besides, the offended party denied that the  defendant was in her  house that morning. Moreover, the testimony  of the municipal  policeman, Timoteo Palis,  corroborates the evidence of the prosecution. This witness testified that  while he  was  on  guard duty at the municipal building a short  while before  4 o'clock on the morning of the said date, the defendant  passed by and advised him that the  policemen should be ready who  were to accompany him, Mesina,  to the sitio of Bibiclat, and that the defendant immediately left and witness  did not know where the latter went.   This testimony, combined with that of the offended party and her two witnesses, and all taken as a whole, produce in the mind a thorough conviction that the defendant did commit the  crime under prosecution.  It is to be presumed that after passing  by the municipal building the defendant went to the house where the crime was committed and climbed up into it through the  window, for this was not very high up. For the reasons stated, the  testimony  of the wife of the defendant can not be considered as  proof of an alibi in his behalf, to the  effect that at the hour and on the date mentioned her husband was in his house and that Elena  Llanera, subsequent to the denunciation of the  crime, had talked with her in order that she might  feel no  resentment - inasmuch as such  statements were not proved and the  offended party denied that she  had  had any conversation whatever with Marcelina Santiago, the defendant's wife. Article 491, aforecited, provides that any private person who shall enter the dwelling of another against the latter's will shall incur the penalty specified therein, and although the inmates of the house did  not forbid the defendant to enter the same, nevertheless and withal when one enters a house by climbing  up into it and passing through  a window thereof which had been closed and was opened by the perpetrator of the crime for  the purpose of his entry, even though no violence was  employed  in doing  so, it is unquestionable that the entry into the  house,  by taking advantage of the darkness and when all the inmates thereof were asleep, bears the character of the  crime of  forcible entry, for the  reason that,  under such circumstances, it is not necessary that there should have been a previous prohibition to enter by the inmates, since this is presumed, and because the  entry into the premises was effected against the  will of the occupants thereof, there being no proof that the  defendant  entered the same with the  permission or the consent of any of them. In the commission of the crime there is no extenuating circumstance  whatever to be considered, but there  is the aggravating one of nocturnity,  since the defendant perpetrated the crime by taking advantage  of  the silence  and darkness of the night: therefore, the  penalty fixed by law of arresto  mayor should be imposed upon him in its maximum degree. For the foregoing reasons it is our opinion  that the judgment  appealed  from  should  be affirmed;  provided, however, that the  defendant shall be sentenced to the penalty of five  months of arresto mayor, to the other penalties of the judgment of the lower court, and to  the costs of this instance.

No. 6923. September 12, 1912 ] THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. VALENTIN BERNABE, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N TORRES, J.: This case  comes to  us on  appeal from a judgment of conviction rendered by the Honorable Simplicio del Rosario, judge. About half past 7 o'clock  in the morning  of July 30, 1910,  while the unmarried girl, Ana Arasigan,  a  minor 14 years  of age, was walking along  San  Sebastian street, on her way from Sampaloc to the millinery store named ""Chic Parisien,"" situated in this city on  the Escolta, where she worked as a seamstress, Valentin Bernabe, who was accompanying her, advised her, on the pretext that it was very late, to take a vehicle in order that she might get to the store quickly.  The  girl,  therefore,  hailed  a carromata which was going by and immediately got into it; but when the vehicle  had gone a  short way, Bernabe suddenly entered the carromata also, sat down beside her and  immediately ordered  the driver to go toward San Miguel  and the Ayala Bridge,  and, notwithstanding that the girl tried to have  the  vehicle stopped in order  thak she might get out of it, as it was not being driven to  the  Escolta,  the driver, by order of Valentin Bernabe, continued to go on until they arrived  at the pueblo of Pasig.   On the way the girl  made no  outcries,  through  the fear of creating a scene, and her abductor assured her that upon their arrival at Pasig they should be married, to which she replied that she was unwilling.  As  soon as they  arrived at the said pueblo, the defendant had the carromata stopped in front of a house into which he endeavored to  make her enter,  and as the girl refused to get out of the vehicle Bernabe  caught her by  the hand  and pulled her, compelling her by  the use of violence to get out  of the carromata, for  one of her slippers  fell to the ground.  At this moment the  girl began to cry, on which account, before the abducted party had entered the said house and while she was near the stairs in view  of  a woman who  was looking  at them from a window  above, a  neighbor,  who  had  seen  what had  occurred, called the policeman Esteban Santos, who conducted both the girl and  her abductor to the municipal building of Pasig, and as there were many  people in the justice of the peace court, he took the girl thence to the house of a physician where she remained until 7 o'clock that evening, when her mother,  Tomasa Garcia, who had been searching for her daughter,  came there and took charge of her. For the foregoing  reasons, and in  view of the  preliminary investigations made at the request of the abducted girl's  mother, an  information was filed  in the Court of First Instance of Rizal, by the provincial fiscal, charging Valentin Bernabe with the crime of abduction,  and,  this cause haying  been  tried, the court, on January  27, 1911, pronounced judgment therein by sentencing the defendant to the penalty of one year eight  months and  twenty-one days of prision correccional, to the accessory penalties and to payment of the costs, from which judgment the defendant appealed. The acts  aforestated  are  in  fact characteristic of the crime of abduction, provided for and  punished by article 446 of the Penal Code, committed with  the offended party's assent and with unchaste  designs, inasmuch as the girl, Ana Arasigan, notwithstanding that she stated to her abductor that she was not willing to  marry him, from the moment that the accused ordered that the vehicle be driven from Quiapo Square toward the pueblo of Pasig, without having  heeded the  desires  and requests of the offended party that it be stopped so that she might get out, as it was  not going toward the store on the Escolta, and being informed of the defendant's determination, did not protest, made no effort whatever to free herself from her abductor, and  did not cry out to  the passers by  for help, while the vehicle was still being driven through such populous places as Quiapo  Square and  Echague and San  Miguel streets, she giving her assent and keeping  silent during so long a trip to Pasig when she could have attracted the notice, on the way, of some policeman  or any passer-by, had she wished to beg help against the wrong  that might be done her.   Therefore it  must be held that  the girl was  taken to Pasig with her assent, notwithstanding that she would not consent  to  the marriage suggested  to her on the way by the accused. The said article of the code does not expressly require that the circumstance of unchaste designs must be present in the  commission   of  the  crime  of abduction punished thereby, since, according to the decision of the supreme court of Spain, rendered on November 30,1875, the doctrine was  established, in  treating  of  the application and  fulfilment of the corresponding  article in the  Penal Code  of Spain, that the purpose of the same was to provide punishment, not for the violence against the party  abducted, especially when her assent  is assumed,  but for  the insult to her family and the alarm caused to it by the disappearance  of  one of its  members who, as well on account  of her age as because of her sex, is more exposed to seduction and deceit;  it being immaterial  where the  abduction  is committed, the Penal Code makes no reference  thereto. On the hypothesis that, according to the rules in practice observed  by the  courts,  abduction  with assent must be accompanied by  unchaste designs, it is therefore proper to affirm that the abduction under  prosecution  was committed with  unchaste purposes and designs,  inasmuch as the defendant, upon his arrival in Pasig with the offended party, instead of  going to the court of  the justice of the peace and presenting himself to that officer, who, he said, was an acquaintance of his, for the purpose of the celebration of the marriage promised the abducted  girl,  he conducted her to a house where he said an aunt of his lived, with  the intention of lodging  there  and, undoubtedly, of carrying out his unchaste designs  or purposes. Had the defendant certainly entertained good and honest intentions toward the offended party, notwithstanding that, according to the latter, he was a mere acquaintance of hers, was not  her suitor,  and had never entered her house, the correct procedure for him would  have been,  after having obtained the girl's consent,  to have spoken to her  mother who, to judge from her  testimony, perhaps would not have refused to consent to the marriage of the defendant with her daughter.  Were it true that the sole intention of the accused in effecting  the abduction was thus to enable him to be married by  a  duly authorized authority or minister of the gospel, he could  very well  have found  such in this city, where ministers of  different religious sects abound, without the need of  taking the abducted girl to the pueblo of Pasig with the  unlawful intent of  placing  her  in  a private house.  The unchaste designs, which the accused undoubtedly had, were not manifested on account of the opportune intervention of a  policeman as a  result of a notice given him by a neighbor who saw the offended party crying and refusing to enter the said house in Pasig in which, had she done so, she would without doubt have been the victim of an unchaste attempt. The defendant's guilt as the sole  proved perpetrator of the  crime under prosecution is very  manifest, for notwithstanding his plea  of not guilty,  still the record of the case furnishes decisive and  conclusive proof,  which produces  full conviction in the mind, that he did  commit the crime  charged; and the  incriminating evidence  adduced at the trial  was not overcome  nor weakened  by his unproven exculpatory allegations. In the commission of the crime, no extenuating  or aggravating circumstance is to be considered; wherefore the penalty provided by law must be  imposed upon  the defendant  in the  medium degree,  as  it was in the judgment appealed from. With respect to the question of competency and  jurisdiction, referred to in the first assignment of error alleged against the  trial judge by the defendant's counsel, it must be taken into account that both the judges of the Courts of First Instance of Manila and of Rizal have jurisdiction and are competent to take cognizance of the crime of abduction. It is true that the abduction  herein  prosecuted was commenced in this city, but it may  well be  said it  was consummated in Pasig, of the  Province of Rizal, where the defendant was  to carry out or intended to execute the unchaste  designs, which  his counsel ignored.  The question of a judge's competency or incompetency is the first one that should opportunely be raised, in order to avoid the submission of the case to a judge who, in the opinion of the  defense, is incompetent  and without jurisdiction  to try the same.  The fact is that such exception of incompetency was not taken in the first instance and the defendant submitted to the authority of the judge of the  court of Rizal during the prosecution of the case, and only alleged it as an  error  incurred by the lower court in its judgment upon appeal in this second instance, wherefore  it is improper because it was not made at the right time. For the foregoing  reasons, whereby the other errors assigned  to  the  judgment  appealed from are  deemed to have been refuted, and holding  that said judgment  is in conformity with the law and the merits of the case, it  is our  opinion  that the same  should be,  as it is hereby, affirmed, with  the,costs of this instance against the appellant, who, in  the  imposition  6f the penalty, shall be allowed credit for one-half of the time of imprisonment suffered by him while awaiting trial. Arellano, C. J., Mapa and Johnson, JJ., concur. DISSENTING Trent, J. , with whom  concurs Carson,  J. , I dissent.  This court says: ""The said  article (446)  of the code does  not expressly require that the circumstance of unchaste  designs must be present in the  commission of the  crime of abduction punished  thereby, since, according to  the  decision of the supreme court of Spain, rendered on November 30, 1875, the doctrine was  established, in treating  of the application and fulfilment of the corresponding article  in the Penal Code of Spain, that the purpose of the  same was to provide punishment, not for the violence against the party abducted, especially when her consent is assumed, but for the insult to her family and the alarm caused to it by the disappearance of one of its members who,  as well on account of her age as because of her sex, is more exposed to seduction and deceit; it being immaterial where the abduction is committed, the Penal Code makes no reference thereto."" Upon examination of the decision  of  the supreme court of Spain referred to in the above quotation it will be  seen that the  defendant took the abducted«girl to an inn and kept her there two  days, during which time he had sexual relations with her.  It is therefore clear that the remarks in question were  unnecessary and consequently mere obiter. In the case of the United States vs . Rodriguez (1 Phil. Rep., 107), this  court,  speaking through Mr. Justice Mapa, said: ""The unchaste  designs  constitute one of the  essential elements that characterize the crime of abduction, as well when  committed  with violence against the will of the woman as when carried out with her consent in case of her minority.  This is precisely  the point which constitutes one of the  principal differences which distinguish  this crime  from crimes against personal liberty and  security. If the removal of a woman from her house, although she be a virgin under the age of 23 years, is committed for the purpose of murdering her or demanding a ransom, or holding her a prisoner somewhere, it would undoubtedly constitute a crime but would by no mean fall under the provisions of the sections of the Penal  Code which define and punish the crime of abduction, but  of other section's quite distinct, although there exists in such case the material fact of the  stealing away of a woman.  This consideration demonstrates that the  unchaste  purpose  is essential  in all cases to the crime  of abduction, and  this same conclusion is deduced from the fact that the crime is classified  in the code among the crimes against chastity."" That unchaste designs  are a necessary or essential element in the  crime of abduction has long since been definitely settled by this court.  The question is no longer an open one, and this court, in now holding otherwise, is in direct  conflict with every decision upon the question  that this court has rendered.  Consequently, if the record in the case at bar fails to disclose that the  appellant accompanied the offended  party from the city of Manila to Pasig with unchaste designs, then he is not guilty of abduction. The  real question presented  is one of fact; that is: Did the defendant take the offended party to Pasig for unchaste designs?  In determining this  question the court  was not merely passing upon the credibility of witnesses, but it was necessary to pass on the reasonableness of the story told by the offended party.   Is her story, under the admitted facts, to be unreservedly accepted as true?  The offended party admits  and so testified  that  she entered the carromata voluntarily.   She also admits and so  testified that she made no outcry nor any resistance whatever from the time she entered the carromata until the  arrival of the couple in Pasig, and that there was nothing offensive in the conduct of the appellant during: this time. The statement of facts adopted by the majority opinion is taken practically in toto from the  testimony  of Ana Arasigan, in the most part wholly unsupported by any other witness, interested or disinterested, and in great part flatly contradicted by the defendant.   The testimony of the latter is corroborated by apparently  two disinterested witnesses who  saw  the  couple enter  the carromata on Calle San Sebastian, by the cochero who drove them to Pasig, also apparently disinterested,  and by the woman of the  house in Pasig where  the defendant and his companion were arrested by the  policeman.  This woman is also an  apparently   disinterested   witness.  Ana  Arasigan  herself further made several admissions which tend to corroborate the testimony  presented  by the defense,  and which also tend  to  seriously  affect the  credibility of  her own story. It is simply a precaution against the miscarriage of justice to require  that where the  testimony  of one witness  is adopted  as against that of several others, especially  when those witnesses whose testimony  is  discountenanced  by that of the single opposing witness are disinterested, to require that the latter give a  consistent and reasonable account of the matter before the court, free from material contradictions. In refutation of the statement of the girl that she was going to work  on the morning in question, we have the testimony of the  defendant that the preceding night they had planned to go to Pasig on the following  day to get married  and were to meet early on the morning of July 30th near  the Sampaloc church for that  purpose.   With reference to the entrance of the  couple into a public carromata , the defendant  states that he called the  carromata. This statement is  supported  by the driver of the vehicle, Manuel Gomez,  and Julian Tumali, a printer on his  way to work, who  knew the defendant, and who, on the trial,  identified the girl.  The defendant and these two witnesses, together with one  Teodoro Alquiros,  a laundryman,  also on his way to work and who likewise  knew the defendant and  identified the  girl  at the trial,  state that the  two entered the carromata together.  The  driver of the carromata testified that on the way to Pasig  the two in conversation  talked of going to the house of the defendant's aunt to get married.  He testified that the  defendant made absolutely no threats  and used  no force while en route from Manila to Pasig.  This testimony is, of  course, corroborated by that of the defendant himself.  The woman, Petra Loreto, testified  that  she was.  a  relative of the  defendant's aunt but no relation of his.   She testified that she saw the carromata containing the  couple  arrive in front of  her house; that the defendant informed her that  they were looking for his aunt to accompany them to the juzgado as they were going to get married. She, in company with the cochero ,  testified that there  was absolutely no force used on the part of the defendant to induce the girl Ana to alight and that the girl alighted first.   Petra. Loreto further testified that the girl alighted on the side nearest her house while the defendant alighted on the other side; that, after paying the driver of the carromata , the two  ascended as far as the landing at the top of the stairs; that she would not permit them to  enter her house because she did not  know them; that just at that moment the policeman came and took both away with him.  As to  the slipper  of the girl which the defendant had in his hand when the policeman arrived on the scene, this witness testified that  in her haste to alight from the carromata the girl had left it within and that after reaching the stairway the defendant returned to the carromata to get the slipper.  The statement in the opinion of the court that the girl refused to get out of the carromata and that thereupon this defendant caught her by the hand and compelled her to alight by the use of force and that one of her slippers fell to the ground during the struggle, is entirely dependent upon  the statement of the  girl herself. On the other hand, we have the testimony of the cochero. Gomez, and of the woman,  Loreto, that the girl alighted unassisted and of her own free will.  I submit that here is another  highly improbable statement on the  part of the girl, Ana.  They stopped at  the house in Pasig at about 8 o'clock in the morning.  That both the defendant and the girl alighted is admitted.  The driver of the carromata was certainly a witness to this scene.  Is it probable that the defendant would  have attempted anything so foolhardy in broad daylight in a populous town?   If he  did use force, how much resistance did the  girl offer?  It is true that the attention of a neighbor was  attracted to the pair and that he notified a policeman.  But the latter states that when he arrived he saw no ""scandal."" It is admitted that the girl reached  the landing at the top of the stairway and that she was  crying after alighting from  the carromata .  The mere fact that she was crying, and that she was a stranger in the neighborhood,  would have been sufficient to arouse the suspicions of this neighbor. Notwithstanding the declaration of the girl,  Ana, on the witness stand that she did not go to Pasig with this appellant of her own free will, this court has found as a fact that such was the case.  As  its  reason for so holding, the court states that had she of a certainty not desired to accompany the accused to Pasig, she could very easily have called for assistance  ""while  the  vehicle  was still  being driven through such populous places as Quiapo Square and Echague and San  Miguel streets.""   In this I agree.  But the court holds that although she did accompany the accused voluntarily, she would n6t accept  the defendant's proposals of marriage.  What purpose had she then in riding with him? According to her story, she was leaving her work and traveling with  a casual  male acquaintance, who was importuning her with offers of marriage  which were not agreeable to her, and  yet,  so the court holds,  she went willingly.  Such a hypothesis of the attitude of this young lady toward the appellant is untenable.   It is too  inconsistent with feminine chastity and modesty, and I am not at all disposed to impute a want of these attributes to this young lady.   The fact that she accompanied him voluntarily and listened to his overtures of marriage, renders highly improbable her assertions that the defendant was merely a slight acquaintance, that she was going to work on the morning in question, and that on the way to Pasig she  refused to entertain his  offers of marriage.  On the other hand, this fact fits in exactly with the testimony of the defendant to  the  effect that on  the preceding night  it was agreed between himself and this girl to go to Pasig and get married there, and that they went there with that object in view.  The girl, Ana, further testified in her direct examination that she did  not know  the driver of the carromata .   On being recalled, she stated that she did remember the driver of the  vehicle and on Manuel Gomez being presented, she testified that he was  not that person.  It  is presumed that she meant by this  that  she remembered the cochero ' s face but  not his name.  I have carefully noted the testimony of the witness Manuel Gomez. There is not a single contradiction in his declarations, and his story agrees  in all material points with that of the other witnesses for the defense.  As set  forth  above, the girl, Ana, in my opinion, mixed falsehood with fact in her direct testimony.  Having  so far departed from the truth, it is quite  possible that she would go a little further and testify untruthfully about a matter in which she was almost sure to escape detection.  Or adopting the most charitable view of the matter possible, her simple denial that Gomez was not the driver, in the face of the latter's statements, should be subject to the rule of  positive and negative testimony, because the identity of the cochero was a matter about which she cannot be presumed to have made any careful observations. Designs such  as are imputed to  the accused are vastly more  easy to carry out at night when the danger of being discovered is reduced to a minimum; and an examination of the cases will show that  abductors are prone  to take advantage of the nighttime.  The accused took this girl to Pasig about eight o'clock in the morning in  an open carromata .  According to the girl's own story, he  took  no  indecent liberties with her in any way whatever. Is it safe for a court of justice to speculate  on  what the intentions of the defendant were on such a basis as the facts of this case  present?  On the one hand we have  the practically uncorroborated testimony of the girl, Ana, which is inherently improbable in many  important  particulars.   Every point in her testimony which  is essential  to  proving  an immoral purpose on the part of the defendant is  contradicted by apparently reliable and disinterested witnesses, and it  is these  very accusations of dishonorable conduct which are inherently improbable.  By what rules for weighing evidence can the conclusion be reached that such a story is true, when it  deviates so  far from ordinary  human conduct, and when it is opposed by a number of witnesses who gave sane and reasonable accounts  of  what they saw and did, which, when pieced together, produce a statement of facts which is consistent and  in harmony  with ordinary human  conduct? It  is  conceded that  it is  not necessary to prove sexual intercourse in order to obtain a conviction under article 446 of the Penal Code.  The mere intent to seduce the girl is sufficient.   But it is submitted that in the absence of overt acts, very cogent proof is needed  to establish a man's intentions. Were there any overt acts on the part of the defendant in the case at bar which were inconsistent with honorable purpose?  In  the  case  decided by  the supreme  court  of Spain on November 30,1875  (cited in the majority opinion), the defendant took the girl to an inn and kept her there two days, during which time he  had carnal relations with her. The court here had something  more than mere intentions upon which to base its judgment of conviction.  Tracing the acts of the defendant in the case at bar from the time  he and the girl Ana entered the carromata until the policeman arrested the two in Pasig, is there anything in the outward      demeanor of the said defendant which can be called improper?  In United States vs . Alvarez (1 Phil, Rep., 351), the  defendant  had the abducted girl  in  his house for a period of ten days.  The  intimacy between the two  had existed for several months notwithstanding that the defendant was already married.  Here was another clear  case in which the court was not obliged to rely upon the unexpressed intentions of the defendant.  In United States vs . Meneses (14  Phil. Rep., 151), the defendant induced  the  girl to accompany him in a earromata on the promise that he would take her before an  officer and  marry her.  After riding around the streets of Manila for some time, he stated that it being Saturday afternoon he could get no one to perform the ceremony, and about  9 o'clock that night took her to a room  where he had sexual intercourse with her. Another clear case of overt acts, or rather fulfilled intentions.  In United States vs . Padua  (7 Phil. Rep., 399), the defendant took the girl from a town  called Candon to a town called San Ildefonso, and on arrival at the Jatter place took her to the convent for the purpose of asking the parish priest  to marry them.  The court  reversed the lower tribunal and set the defendant at liberty.  It seems to me that the reasons back of this decision were (1) that the defendant committed  no overt acts showing  unchaste designs, and (2) the facts of the case did not sufficiently show that his intentions were unchaste in taking the girl away from home. In the United States vs . Ysip (6 Phil. Rep., 26), the defendant was a peddler.   On arriving at the town of Bacon, he made the acquaintance of the girl and obtained her consent as well as her mother's to a marriage, the record not disclosing why he  did  not ask for the consent of the girl's father.  While the father was absent in a neighboring town, the girl, accompanied by her mother and two little brothers, started with the defendant for his native province with the intention of marrying him.   After  being on the road two days, her father overtook the party  and a charge of abduction  was filed against the accused, which was sustained in the lower court.   This court  set the defendant at liberty. The court said: ""We think, however, that the premises do not justify the conclusion (of  the trial court  that in taking1 the girl to his native province without previously marrying her the presumption of improper motives  was created), and we are confirmed in this opinion by the fact that the accused burdened himself in his flight with the impedimenta of a prospective mother-in-law and her two minor children , and also by the exemplary conduct of the young  couple on  their journey as far as they succeeded in making it, for it was conclusively proven that during their flight the  girl never  left her mother's side."" Here, again,  there were no  overt acts on the part of the defendant, and his avowed  design of marrying the young lady was completely frustrated, leaving the court to  speculate as  freely  upon what might have been his  real intentions in  the matter as in the case at bar.  Yet the  court did not consider the  evidence sufficient to show unchaste designs.  In all the cases  I have  had the opportunity of examining, wherein a conviction was obtained under article 446 of the Penal Code, there were sexual relations between the defendant and the abducted girl.  On the other hand, in all those cases which have reached this court  wherein the defendant had been sentenced in the lower court for his intentions only, the judgment was reversed.  I believe it is therefore safe  to assert that  if there be any adjudicated case wherein the defendant has been convicted under article 446 solely on his intentions, there must have been potent facts which showed his manifest designs  too strongly for any reasonable doubt.   It is not impossible, under this article, as stated above, to  convict a defendant on his clearly expressed intentions.   Such a result would obtain if, for example, in the present case the defendant had been already married; or if he had  taken  any indecent liberties  with her.   Such facts would have sufficiently shown his unchaste design.   But, as I have said, there were no overt acts on the part of the defendant in the case at bar, and the court must rely upon the intentions  of the defendant as far as they can be ascertained from his conduct up to the time he was arrested by the policeman.  Speaking of the defendant's   intentions, the  court says: ""Were it true that the sole  intention of the accused in effecting the abduction, was  thus  to  enable him  to be married by a duly authorized authority or minister  of the gospel, he could very well have  found such in  this city, where ministers of  the different religious  sects abound, without the need of taking the  abducted girl to the pueblo of Pasig with the unlawful intent of placing her in a private house."" Here the court in effect attempts to outline the correct procedure for a couple who have eloped with the intention of getting married.  If the couple do not go to the nearest minister or official competent to perform the ceremony, the would be husband may  be  convicted  of  abduction  under article 446 of the  Penal Code.  The temptation to indulge in levity presents itself in considering any such restrictions upon the  methods adopted by  couples who elope for the purpose of getting married.   But  in  all seriousness, the liberty and innocence of a citizen  is at stake.  He is facing a term of nearly two years in the penitentiary..  In the  case of United States vs . Ysip  ( supra ), the couple were going from one province into another, requiring a trip of several days.  Yet this court rejected the idea that the defendant in that case had unchaste designs because he did not marry the young lady in  her own town.  Also,  in  the case of the United States vs . Padua  ( supra ), it was doubtless unnecessary for the defendant to take his loved one to another town to have the marriage ceremony  performed.   It appears  that the persons concerned in these two cases had sacrificed  convenience for the sake of 8ome other unascertained purpose in connection with their desire to get married.  Parties frequently travel  a long way to have the marriage  ceremony performed by a particular personage, in a particular place, or for some other particular reason.  This court is going far into the realm of uncertain speculation in attributing improper motives to the defendant in the case at bar because he took his bride-to-be to Pasig to have the ceremony performed instead of having it done in Manila.  In reference to taking the girl to the house where he supposed his aunt lived instead of taking her to the justice of the peace court, the  court  draws another inference  of unchaste designs, saying: ""The unchaste designs, which the accused undoubtedly had,  were  not manifested  on account of  the opportune intervention of a policeman  as a result of  a notice given him by a neighbor who saw the offended party crying and refusing to enter the said house in Pasig in which, had she done so, she would without doubt have been the victim of an unchaste attempt."" Yet the only testimony in the record on the point is that of the woman of that house, who states that she refused entrance to the  two.  It  further appears  that defendant's aunt was not there, and that the woman of the house did not know either the defendant or the girl Ana.   Is it possible that the defendant, with the immoral purpose attributed to him by the court, would have taken the girl to a house where he was  not known?  To my mind, such a purpose calls for connivance and conspiracy on the part of the owner  of the house.  There is not that certainty of acquiescence on the part of an unknown person in such an immoral purpose as would induce an abductor to apply for the use of his house to aid in its fulfilment.  I think the court Ijere goes further into the realm of speculation  as to what the defendant's intentions were.  It is also admitted that the girl was crying when the policeman arrived  and that she then and  thereafter made statements inconsistent with any desire to marry the defendant,  If judicial notice may be taken of so tender a subject,  it may be  said that it is not uncommon to see adult women of the best families crying  just previous to the marriage ceremony, when they are surrounded by their   relatives and friends  and everything is being done in the most orthodox  fashion.  It may even  be insinuated that there have been  instances of the  bride-to-be refusing to fulfil her part of the contract at the last moment.   How much more, then, may we expect to see this young girl, 14 years of age, poor and unediicated, who had left her home under such circumstances, adopting such tactics? Viewing the  abortive  attempt of the defendant in the light of the evidence adduced, it is clear that whatever his plans were, he  failed to  carry any of them to completion except that of getting the girl, Ana, to the town of Pasig. The recorded account of that journey is such that the defendant could have proceeded in an  honorable manner to the fulfilment of his stated design of marrying the girl had not the guardians of the peace prevented him from doing so. It is elementary when a  special  intent is required to make an act an  offense, that the doing of the act does not  raise a presumption  that it was done with  the specific intent. (People vs . Plath, 100 N. Y., 590, 53 Am. Rep., 236, citing Lawson, Presumptive Evidence,  472.) I am therefore of the opinion that the prosecution has not only failed to establish the guilt of the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt, but  that the appellant has established his innocence beyond any question.

No. 1237. September 30, 1903 ] THE UNITED STATES, COMPLAINANT AND APPELLEE, VS. LEONARDO GUINACARAN ET AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N TORRES, J.: On January 30, 1903, the provincial fiscal  of Tayabas Province  filed a complaint in the Court of First Instance charging  the defendants Avith having,  under the guise of insurgents, committed the crime of brigandage. The defendants were Leonardo Guinacaran, a so-called colonel of the organization; Juan Par, Gregorio  Palmero, and Bonifacio Andalis, denominated majors; Lucio Santamina, Catalino Verdan, Roque Principe, Estanislao Padines, Eufemio Principe, Julio  Benito, Egmidio Sarmiento, Abdon  Andalis, and Dionisio Andalis, captains; Sergio Andalis, Vicente Parafina,  Candido Machete, Pedro Garin, and Carlos Principe, first lieutenants; Sinforoso Principe, Oornelio  Urlanda,  Crisanto  Sol,  Nicolas  Principe,  and Carlos Principe, second lieutenants of the organization, and  Pablo Par and Patricio Verdan, sergeants.   The organization was known as ""The  Liberating Army of the Philippines.""   The complaint also included one Feliciano Andalis.   The defendants were charged with having committed the crime of brigandage in the following manner: Late on the night of December 27, 1902, they entered the house of Pantaloon Losing, situated in the barrio of Calutan, town of Unisan, Tayabas  Province, in the Seventh Judicial  District, and stole therefrom  money and  such other personal property as they thought they could make use of, consisting of a boiler  of  the value of $3.50,  five gantas of rice worth $2.50, twelve  plates worth $3.60, four suits  of clothes worth $24, a pair of shoes valued at $2.50, a hat wortli $5, two undershirts'worth $1.50, two  pairs of drawers valued at $1.50, nine shirts valued at $35, a ship's lamp of the value of $50, eight chemises worth $28, three aprons worth $7.70, a pair of earrings worth $10, a comb set with pearls  valued at $7, a stick pin set with pearls valued at $6,  a gold ring set with  pearls worth  $6, and certain documents of credit, the total value of the property stolen being equivalent to $180, Mexican currency. Not content with having committed this theft,  they kidnaped  the owner of the house, Pantaleon Losing, and his wife, Cirila Ubal.  They bound Pantaleon and carried him and his wife to the place called Puting Lupa, where they had what was called ""The encampment of the Liberating Army of the Philippines.""  The prisoners  were there each tied to a tree, and Pantaleon Losing, after having been beaten with a club, was taken before the so-called ""lieutenant-commander of the army,"" one  Esteban Deseo,  who, after  holding a council of Avar, condemned  both the prisoners to the penalty of death; all  this in violation of  the provisions of section 1 of Act No. 518. The information  also included  Lucas Pureza,  Martin Principe,  Cornelio TJrlanda, Nicolas Principe, Pablo Par, Maria Aguilar,  Apolonia  Alba, Prisca  Principe,  Teofila Aguilar, Vicenta Aguilar, Primitiva Aguilar,  Policarpia Mulata, Benita Causapin, Eufina Principe,  Fausta  Uri, and Filomena Estrada, upon the charge that before,  during, and after  the commission of the crime prosecuted herein they gave aid and comfort to the band of brigands of which the accused above named constituted  a part, by furnishing them and  other members of the band with information concerning the movements of the police, receiving stolen property from them, providing them  with food, clothes,  and  ammunition,  and  otherwise  aiding  and abetting them, in violation of section 4 of Act No. 518. The trial having been commenced, the complaining  witness, Pantaleon Losing, was examined.   He testified  that he knew all the accused, some of them  being residents of his barrio,  and others living in barrios  near by; that  late on the night of December 27, 1902, while asleep with his wife  and other persons in his house  in  the  barrio of Calutan, he was aroused by the presence therein of Juan Par, Juan Magnay, and Candido Machete, who  were looking for the witness and his wife,  Cirila; that Par  and Machete seized and bound the witness, while Magnay did the same to Manuel Alba, who, with the brothers Julio  and Brigido  Benito, composed  the  three other persons mentioned who were passing the night there; that the four were then  taken  out of the house and  that after  leaving it Hilario Pureza struck the witness a blow on the right arm with a club; that Pureza ordered that  the witness's wife, Cirila, be brought out of the house, and  that the prisoners were  then conducted  to the so-called encampment of  the malefactors, situated at Puting Lupa or Mabugabuga; that they arrived at this place at about 10 o'clock the following morning and were there held in confinement, the witness with his feet in stocks; that upon being brought  before the second in command of the organization, Esteban Deseo, the latter condemned them to death for having, as he said, informed the Constabulary of the departure of the chief of the band, Felipe Verastegni, for the Island of Marinduque, on which occasion Verastegui was surprised and killed by Inspector Julio Herrera and his  soldiers; that the witness begged Deseo and the other chief  officers, Gabriel Banal and Hilario Pureza, to delay the execution of this sentence in order that he might prepare himself for death, which request was granted; that on the day following, which was the (ith of January, the day devoted to the celebration of the festival of the Three Kings and on which he was to be put to death, the encampment was attacked by the Constabulary and volunteers and that the malefactors  thereupon fled, but that owing to the distance of the place of confinement of the  witness from  the encampment the Constabulary failed to discover him at that time; and that as  he was unable  to free himself from the stocks he remained imprisoned until the following Sunday, when the Constabulary returned to the place and found him; that on the night of the  assault the malefactors stole from his house clothing, a sail, and other goods,  including jewelry and documents of credit, to the value  of 180 Mexican pesos; that while at the encampment he recognized among other persons there Leonardo Guinacaran, Egmidio Sarmiento, Bonifacio  Andalis, Abdon Andalis, Sergio Andalis, Pablo Par, Pedro Garin, Juan Par,  Eufemio Principe, Nicolas Principe, Carlos Principe, Roque Principe, Sinforoso Principe, Carlos Principe, jr., Candido Machete, Jacinto Sol, Lucas Pureza, Martin Principe, Catalino Verdan, Patricio Verdan, Lucio Santamina, Dionisio Andalis, Gregorio Palmero, Estanislao Pardines, and  Cornelio  Orlanda,  and others whom he could  not  remember; that the men  who stayed in this encampment lived on food which was stolen from day to  day in the  neighboring barrios, and that  they were armed  with rifles, shotguns, revolvers, lances, large bolos, and daggers. Cirila Ubal, wife of the complaining witness, and Manuel Alba, Brigido Benito, and  Julio Benito corroborated the testimony of Pantaleon Losing, the woman, Cirila, adding that as she  and her husband were led  off by some  of the malefactors a number  of their  companions  entered the house  to search it; that while she and her husband were held as  prisoners they  were court-martialed  on  a charge of  having given information to the Constabulary of the whereabouts  of Felipe Verastegui, a so-called  general, who was surprised and killed by  the  Constabulary, and that on  this account  the generals,  Esteban Deseo, Gabriel  Banal,  and Hilario  Pureza,  accompanied  by Egmidio Sarmiento,  notified them  on the  5th  day of January that they must  prepare  for death, as she and her husband were to be shot on the following day,  the 6th; that at noon on the  day designated for their execution the encampment was surprised by  the Constabulary and volunteers, and  that the malefactors having fled  she was rescued by  Lieutenant  Herrera and  taken to  the town.   Manuel  Alba further stated  that  he succeeded in escaping on the night of the assault, owing to the darkness and confusion and hid in the neighboring forest; that early on the morning of the day following he presented himself before the municipal authorities for  the purpose of reporting all that had taken place; that lie  believed those who assaulted Losing's house  were engaged in robbery and stole from  the townspeople, as he had heard a number of people  complaining  of  being robbed  by  brigands who formed a part of this band.  Julio Benito  stated that he had recognized many of the defendants  among those who committed  the robbery in  the house of Pantaleon Losing, and that this was the only band  in existence  near that place; that the malefactors  who formed the  band commanded  by Esteban  Deseo and Hilario Pureza were  the same ones who, on August 30 of that year, entered the town of Unisan,  burned official documents and robbed a number of houses.   Brigido Benito testified that, when the same malefactors departed from the  scene of the  occurrence taking with them the complaining Avitness and Manuel Alba,  they  also obliged him to accompany them, and that although he did not go to the encampment of the malefactors he believes they wrere all members of the same band. Anacleta Amparo, Losing's servant, corroborated the testimony of these witnesses.   She  testified that,  after her master and mistress  were  led away,  several of the malefactors entered the house,  compelled her to lie down and then commenced to search the house, and that they carried off a number of articles which they had  found. Julio Herrera,  lieutenant of the Constabulary forces, testifies that on January 6, 1903, he surprised the encampment of the malefactors at a place  called Puting Lupa or Mabugabuga, and after a short resistance on the part of the bandits, who were  commanded  by Hilario Pureza, among others, they fled; that the witness  and his subordinates succeeded in capturing  arms,  clothing,  documents, and other goods, as well as Estanisiao Pardines and a number of women , and at the same time rescued Cirila Ubal; that he burned some twenty houses in which he found uniforms of the thieves, by some of  whom  several shots were fired from the neighboring forest; that on the day following he continued his search through the woods, and, notAvithstanding some  resistance, succeeded  in  capturing four of the robbers, named Leonardo Guinacaran, Juan Par, Lucas  Pureza, and Martin Principe, and  also some women and children ;  that according to  the  documents seized by him,  the gang  was  organized with political purposes inimical to the constituted government, and that these  malefactors called themselves  enemies of all employees and officers of the Government, the organization being styled ""The National Liberating Army of the Philippines.""  According  to the  witness's information the principal  officer was one Reus.  He stated he understood that,  for  the  purpose  of  concealing  its real object, the organization had been established  under  the guise of a religious association; that,  although their motto was ""Independence,"" their acts showed that their real object was brigandage  and that  they  had  given  their  organization political appearance merely as a ruse to conceal the fact that they were a band of brigands living upon food stolen by them in the neighboring towns; that he had captured a number of the defendants and a number of women , and the witness  gave the names of many other  persons who had not  been apprehended.   The witness  further  stated that a number of these persons had taken part in the assault upon the toAvn of Unisan on August 30, 1902, in the course of which they maltreated the  municipal authorities, burned official documents, and robbed  a number of houses, the band having  at that time been commanded by Felipe Verastegui, who was.subsequently killed; that the same band, in the following September, assaulted and robbed the town of Laguimanoc; that the documents and commissions which were captured at the time of the surprise showed that the defendants, and other persons not arrested, formed a part of the band; that in the encampment they found certain goods which were identified by the complaining witness and his wife, and that some of the malefactors had  already  surrendered on  account  of the vigorous campaign conducted against them. Guillermo Claveria, Juan Vera, Gregorio Vera  Cruz, Ambrosio Alerano,  Juan Brillon, and  Aguedo  Cataqui, residents of the toAvn of Unisan; Aloises Uralesa, a member of the municipal police;  Benito  Isaac, a volunteer, and Subinspector Herrera stated that the defendants were members of the band which assaulted a number of houses in the town of Unisan on August 30, 1902, burned a  lot  of the official documents in the municipal and justice's court, and robbed  and illtreated the inhabitants; that  the same gang, on the 3d of September following, assaulted a number of houses in Laguimanoc and stole property belonging  to the inhabitants; that on the 27th of December of  the same year malefactors to the number of some forty or more, and belonging to the same band, entered and robbed the house of Pantaleon Losing, carried him and his wife  away  to the  encampment  of the robbers and there held  them  as prisoners.  These witnesses stated that the robbers lived upon property stolen by them in the neighboring barrios. The witness Isaac further testified that on August 30 the malefactors compelled him to open the municipal safe,  of which he had possession as treasurer, but that they found no money in the safe, as his wife had taken the precaution to hide the money that had been in it.  The Avitness Brillon testified that when  attempting  to escape  from the malefactors on August 30, in the town of Unisan, he received a gunshot wound which took twenty-five days to heal. The prosecuting attorney asked the court to dismiss the complaint against the  defendants  Oornelio Urlanda and Pablo Par, 12 and 14 years of age, respectively, and Martin Principe and Lucas Pureza, respectively 66 and  73 years of age, so that they might be called as witnesses for the prosecution.  This request was granted, and upon being examined the four persons mentioned testified that  their codefendants and other persons not under arrest lived at a place called Mabugabuga, known as ""The Encampment;"" that they were all armed and that they lived on what they succeeded in stealing from the neighboring barrios; that the leaders of the band were Esteban Deseo, Gabriel Banal, and Hilario Pureza, and that the wives and other relatives of the malefactors were accustomed to pass the day praying and counting their beads.  These witnesses also  testified to having seen Pantaleon Losing and his wife among the women who lived in the encampment. The prosecuting attorney then moved the court to admit this testimony as evidence for the prosecution, as well as certain documents taken from the  defendants, consisting of sundry commissions and  personal  cedulas.  The witnesses were called upon to state whether they objected to the admission of their  testimony  and the documents referred to as evidence in the case; they made no objection thereto, saying that their statements had been made freely and voluntarily.  The attorney for the defense having also failed to object to the introduction of this evidence, it was admitted by the court. The defendants  plead not guilty.  Although they  admitted that they were all members of the party commanded by Generals Banal, Deseo, and Pureza, at a place called Mabugabuga, where the encampment occupied by them as insurgents was located,  they denied having robbed and kidnaped Pantaleon Losing and his wife and alleged that they did not take part in the  assault upon Losing's house on  December 27, 1902.   Candido  Machete, on  the other hand, testified that his  companions did commit the robbery in the house of Pantaleon Losing, although he insisted that he himself took no part in the assault. The judge below, on Eebruary 5,1903, entered judgment, imposing upon the defendants Leonardo Guinacaran, Juan Par, Bonifacio Andalis, and Egmidio Sarmiento the penalty of life  imprisonment (prision perpetua) ;  upon Gregorio Palmero, Catalino Verdan, Roque Principe, Estanislao  Pardines, Abdon Andalis, Dionisio Andalis, Eufemio Principe, and Lucio Santamina the penalty of twenty-five years' imprisonment; upon Sergio Andalis, Vicente Parafina, Pedro Garm, Carlos Principe, Jr., Carlos Principe, sr., Sinforoso Principe, and Candido Machete the penalty of twenty years'  imprisonment; and upon each  one of the defendants the payment of one-thirty-ninth part of the costs of  the prosecution,  With subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency.  The judgment acquitted the defend- ants Patricio Verdan, Feliciano Andalis, Jacinto  Sol, Nicolas Principe, Maria Aguilar, Apolonia Alba, Prisca Prin- cipe, Teoiila Aguilar, Vicenta Aguilar, Primitiva Aguilar, Policarpia  Mulata, Benita Causapin,  Bufina Principe, Fausta Uri, Maria  Uri, and Filomena  Estrada,  and remitted the costs corresponding to them. Against this judgment the nineteen defendants who were convicted entered an appeal.  The case having been brought before us on this appeal, the counsel for the defendants asked that the judgment be modified and the penalty reduced to twenty years' imprisonment for each defendant, for the reasons stated in his brief.  The Solicitor-General in his brief urges that the judgment be affirmed without modification, with  the costs of this second instance to the defendants. Act No. 518, enacted and published on the 12th of November, 1902, by the Civil  Commission  of these Islands, provides,  in  paragraph 1, that all persons who conspire together and form a band for the purpose of  committing robbery by means of force and violence , and who with this object shall go out  upon the highway or  roam over the country armed with deadly weapons, and every person thereafter joining such band shall  be deemed highway robbers or brigands, and upon conviction  thereof shall be punished by death or imprisonment for not less than twenty years, in the discretion of the court. The facts established by the evidence in  this case show that the eighteen appellants, together with Dionisio Andalis,  who died in the public  prison of  this  city  April 15, 1903, and other persons still at  large formed part of a large band of malefactors operating under the  guise of a politico-military organization; that the sole purpose of the band was robbery and kindred crimes; that its members lived in the interior of the forest and preyed on the peaceful inhabitants  of  the  towns near Mabugabuga  or  Puting Lupa, who were the victims of their depredations long before Act No. 518 was passed, and that these malefactors habitually followed the  life  of brigands.   Late  on the night of December 27,  1902, they assaulted the house of Pantaleon Losing, in the barrio of Unisan, and robbed him of jewelry, clothing, and other articles of the total value of ISO  pesos, Mexican  currency, and that,  after having beaten  the complaining witness and his wife, they  kidnaped both and illegally detained  them at Mabugabuga, where they were held for eleven days under sentence of death by shooting, which was to have been carried out on the evening of the day on which the encampment was surprised and the prisoners released. Section 2 of the act cited provides that, for the purpose of proving the crime of brigandage, it  is not  necessary to adduce  evidence that any member of the band has in fact committed robbery or  theft, but that the fact that the defendant was a member of such an armed party shall be sufficient to justify conviction. It is fully proven in the record that the appellants and other persons were members of a band organized ostensibly for political purposes, but whose real object was brigandage.   This fact is  established by  the testimony  of  the defendants, and, although the assault  on the town of Unisan on August 30, 1902, by the armed band of which these defendants were members, during which official documents were  burned and a  number of inhabitants  of the town robbed,  and the robbery  of a number of the residents of the town of Laguimanoc on September 3  following, occurred before the passage of the brigandage act of November 12, 1902,  the assault on the night of December 27, 1902, upon the house of Pantaleon  Losing, when he was robbed and kidnaped as above stated, took place after the enactment of that law.  Furthermore, the robbery herein prosecuted is not only proven by the evidence of several witnesses who testified as to Losing's previous possession  of the property stolen and who were present at the time of the assault but also by  the fact that some of the stolen articles were recovered by the Constabulary officers and were subsequentlv identified by the owner. The offense was committed  by a  numerous  band  of armed malefactors who, availing' themselves of the darkness of night, entered an inhabited house, committed the crime of robbery and then kidnaped two of the inmates. It follows that the crime has been committed by brigands, members of a band expressly organized  for the purposes of brigandage, and  under such circumstances as to indicate a high degree of criminality on the part of the defendants, there having  been present no  mitigating  circumstances. For this reason, and for the reasons given by the judge  of the court below, we are' of the opinion that the judgment appealed should be affirmed.   As to the defendants who were  acquitted since no  appeal was  taken against the judgment of the court below with respect to these defendants, the judgment is final as far as they are concerned; and as to the deceased, Dionisio Andalis, the case must be dismissed. For  the reasons  above set forth, we are of the opinion that with respect  to  the  other eighteen defendants the judgment appealed should be  affirmed.  One-nineteenth part of the costs of this  instance will be  borne by each  of the appellants, but in case of insolvency no  subsidiary imprisonment will be imposed.   The case will be dismissed as to the deceased, Dionisio Andalis,  with the remaining one-nineteenth part of the costs of this instance de oficio . The case  will be remanded to the court below, accompanied by a copy  of this decision, for execution of judgment.   So ordered. Arellano, C. J., Cooper, Willard, Mapa, and McDonough, JJ., concur.

D E C I S I O N MORELAND, J.: The defendant in this case was convicted of the crime of bandolerismo. He was charged with having been the chief of a large band of outlaws and desperadoes which bore the name of ""Santa Iglesia;"" which for several years terrorized the Provinces of Bulacan, Nueva  Ecija, Tarlac, Bataan, and Pampanga.  He was duly convicted after a long trial and sentenced to death.  From that judgment of conviction no appeal has  been taken.  The case is before us en consulta . On the 8th of August, 1900, the accused took the oath of allegiance to the  Government of the United  States before Lieut.  Col.  K. E. Wilier   of the  Forty-third  Infantry. Scarcely, however, had he taken  his oath than he began to violate it.  His acts of sedition, if not rebellion, became so open that he was  subsequently captured and convicted  of sedition. In 1902 or 1903 he broke jail and escaped.  Having obtained his freedom he entered upon a career which, from about the year 1902 until the 24th of July, 1910, when he was again captured, made his name a fear and  a dread among the  peaceful inhabitants  of an  extensive territory. The band, of which he was the head, wrought havoc among the peaceful pueblos of the provinces named for more than seven years.  In June, 1902, this band, composed of from two to three hundred people,  at least partly armed, attacked the barrio  of  Santa Rita, pueblo of  Cabiao, Province of Nueva Ecija, shouting as their battle cry ""Viva Santa Iglesia.""  In this  assault they  captured five residents of the pueblo and carried them  away as prisoners.  On the 19th of June, 1903, this same band attacked the pueblo  of San Juan de Guimba, Province of Nueva Ecija, taking from the local police their arms and ammunition.   In the same month and year the same band, composed of about fifty persons, most of them armed with guns or revolvers, having disguised themselves  as  Constabulary  and  announcing themselves as such,  raided the pueblo of Jaen, Nueva Ecija.  They attacked the principal municipal building, stole several guns and revolvers, with ammunition, and captured the municipal president, a person named Apolinario Gimenez, and  three municipal policemen.  On the 2d day of July, 1903, ten members of the Philippine  Constabulary located in the barrio of San Miguel, pueblo  of Concepcidn, Province of Tarlac, were poisoned by members of this band, by direct order of the accused, for the purpose of obtaining the arms and ammunition which  they  carried.  During the  same month the said band, composed of about one hundred persons, armed with revolvers and bolos,  entered the pueblo of Mabalacat, Province of Pampanga, and assaulted the Constabulary quarters  in said town, crying ""Viva Santa Iglesia,"" capturing six Springfield rifles, three guns, six revolvers, with ammunition, and three pair of shoes belonging to the soldiers.  In this  attack they killed a Constabulary soldier called Anacleto Galang and captured another named Benito Galang.  On the 1st day of  February, 1903, this band, composed of about two hundred men, armed  with bolos, daggers, and clubs entered the pueblo of San  Jose, Nueva Ecija, and assaulted the quarters of the Constabulary, stealing nine guns, with cartridges and ammunition, and wounding two of the Constabulary.   On the 15th of September, 1908, the same band,  composed of about three hundred persons, armed  with thirty guns, a second time assaulted  the  pueblo of San Jose,  Nueva Ecija, with the battle-cry of ""Viva Felipe Salvador,"" attacked the  Constabulary quarters, killed a Constabulary soldier, and  stole two guns and some accouterments.   This action  was directed by Felipe Salvador, who, not desiring to expose himself personally to the danger involved in the attack, remained at Malapad na Bato near by.   In September, 1903, the band, at that time containing about one hundred and fifty .men, armed with bolos and clubs, raided the barrio of San Vicente, Province of Nueva Ecija, and captured about one hundred persons, including women and children .  In the month of January or February of the year 1906 the accused, Felipe  Salvador,  as chief of the  said band  of brigands known as ""Santa Iglesia,"" issued a circular  letter calling on the people of Hagonoy and Calunapit in the Province of Bulacan to assemble at  Mount Arayat for the purpose of attacking the Constabulary quarters at Malolos, capital of the Province of  Bulacan.  Many  of the residents of these places complied  with the order  and made their  way to Mount Arayat, where they were met by the  accused.  As a result of this gathering a new band was formed  bearing the same name.  On the night of the 15th of April, 1906, armed with guns, revolvers, daggers, and bolos, they entered the pueblo of Malolos aforesaid, crying ""Viva Felipe Salvador—Viva Santa Iglesia—Viva Apong Ipi,"" and assaulted the Constabulary quarters, killing three Constabulary privates  and wounding four others,  stealing  twenty  guns, seventeen belts, each one containing fifty cartridges.  They captured  Juan Palomo,  who  was  held  as  a prisoner on Mount Sinucuan  or  Mount Arayat nearly six weeks.  On the 9th day of July, 1906, this same band, composed of about fifty-three persons, armed with thirty-seven guns and other arms, and following the  orders of the accused in this case, fought a battle  with a company of Constabulary soldiers in  'the pueblo of Hagonoy,  Bulacan,  in  which one Constabulary soldier was killed and four members of the attacking band met their death.  In the month of March,  1910, this band of outlaws, led personally by the accused, Felipe Salvador, assembled to the number of about three hundred persons at Mount Arayat,  Province of Pampanga,  for the purpose of raiding the pueblo of Santa Ana and of assaulting and capturing the quarters of the Constabulary  at said place.  This  purpose was  not accomplished,  however,  by reason of the action of the authorities, which prevented its success.  Notwithstanding this fact, however, in the month of April, the band, armed, and directed personally  by the accused, entered the pueblo of Arayat, in the Province of Pampanga, and there on the following night fought a battle with the Constabulary in which one of the band was killed. This is in synthesis the history of the operations  of this notorious band and its still more notorious leader.  During        the seven or eight years  to  which we have referred the Government was almost continually sending out expeditions for the destruction or capture of the band.   During this time the Government apprehended and punished more than a score of its' members.  The sums of money paid out by the Government in expeditions senj out against said  band, together with the  value of the property which said band captured and destroyed during its operations, amounted probably to nearly  one million pesos. The  accused,  in  his  testimony  upon the trial, admitted having been the founder and the supreme chief of the band known  as  ""Santa  Iglesia;""  that it  had been organized through his efforts  during the revolution against Spain and had continued until the time of his capture.  He asserted, however, that such  band was not a band of brigands or desperadoes but was  composed  of law-abiding  citizens, and that the sole end and purpose of the organization was to ""pray to God for mercy.""   In  the face of the overwhelming proofs in this case, such assertion does not even reach the dignity of an excuse.  The object and purpose of an organization  are best  demonstrated by its  acts or its results. It matters not what may be its constitution or  what may be the objects set down on paper.  If such organization dedicates itself to pillage and murder,  to nightly attacks on unoffending  citizens, to the destruction of homes and of property, to the capture of innocent men and women , it is a band of robbers and murderers, no matter what may be its objects as set down on paper or those proclaimed by its leader.  All these things this band did; and while it was doing them the  accused was  their chief, maintaining the organization by his  force of character,  using his genius for leadership to make  it effective, and sending it forth under the cover of night with instructions to attack and kill. Counsel for the  accused  rests the argument which he presents upon two bases.  The first one is that the accused was not personally  present  at the time when  the raids of this band took place and, therefore, should not be held responsible for them  and the acts committed in the course           thereof.  The second is that, even if the accused were personally present, the penalty which he should suffer should be imposed under Act  No.  2036 of the Philippine Legislature, lately enacted, which deals with the crime of bandolerismo and notably modifies the severity of the penalties prescribed  by the Act which was in force at the time of the commission of the  crimes alleged. As to the first point little need be said.  It is of no consequence,  legally speaking, whether or not Felipe Salvador was  present  during  the raids of his band.   If they were under his  leadership,  if  they   did  the things  which  he commanded, if he planned  their campaigns of pillage and violence ,  and gave the orders  which they executed it is immaterial  whether he  was personally  present or not. That the defendant was at Mount Arayat while his band was  at Malolos is not  a controlling factor under  all  the circumstances of  this case.   Although  absent from many of the raids, including this one, nevertheless his genius had obtained  the men, had  organized them,  had laid the plans and directed the attacks.  Although miles away, his spirit and personality animated his men and were incarnated in the battle cry of ""Viva Felipe Salvador, "" ""Viva Apong Ipi."" Although absent,  their  faith in him filled them with an exultant courage; for was he not to them always, ""Felipe, Salvador del Mundo?"" Moreover, should ignorance and superstition be punished when the intelligence and ability which  take advantage of them go free?  Is not the one whose ambition, intelligence, and genius  welds  into a weapon of offense the ignorance, prejudice; religious fervor and, mayhap, patriotic sentiment of others and hurls it into the midst of peaceful communities  with the  injunction to  destroy and  kill, fully as guilty as they whose   sentiments and  passions he  has aroused to attain his sinister purposes?   Is he whose ambitions, intelligence,  and  genius have worked upon the untrained faculties of others less responsible for the results than  the poor, deceived,  and  overwrought men upon whom liis genius  has  imposed?  But  for the baneful influence   of the accused at bar, but for his gift for organization, his genius for command, and an ambition which hesitated at no scruple, halted at no deed, and which drove everything before it, the members of his band, many of whom are now convicts  or outlaws,  would have followed the vocations of peace,  much valuable property would have been saved, and the years during which he operated would have  been, for many,  years of security and plenty instead of fear and want. We  do not believe  that the ignorant victims should be punished, while the one whose skill and cunning victimized them goes free. As to  the second  point.   The  attorney for the accused asserts the proposition, under proper conditions well recognized in  Spanish law,  that a subsequent law punishing a crime less severely than a law previously enacted shall have retroactive effect and the penalty imposed for  crime, even though committed prior to the passage of the latter, shall be governed by the terms of the milder Act.  He, therefore, contends that Act No. 2036 of the Philippine Legislature, although a later Act,  should apply to this case.   In this contention counsel forgets that portion of the Act in question which  relates to the  condition which is  presented when, at the time  the crime of bandolerismo is committed,  there are committed other crimes of a graver and higher nature.   In other words, he failed to take into consideration that portion which provides that,  if during the commission of the crime of bandolerismo the band should also commit the crime of murder,  for example, the members of the band, although at the  time engaged in the crime of bandolerismo , might also be prosecuted for the  crime of murder.  In the case at bar several murders were committed by this band  and there were several  robberies with homicide.  We have already held in the case of U. S. vs. De Guzman  (19 Phil., Rep., 350)  that where the information contains facts sufficient to constitute the crime of murder or the crime of robbery with homicide, the accused may be convicted of such crime even though the caption  of the information charges bandolerismo .   In  that case we said: ""The facts alleged in the information fully, clearly and distinctly charge  the  crime of robbery with homicide,  as defined and penalized in article 502, paragraph 1,  of the Penal Code, as well as  the  crime  of bandolerismo . *       *       *       * * * * ""The crime of bandolerismo , as set out in the above information,  includes the crime of robbery with homicide. We have repeatedly held that  an accused may, the  proofs warranting it, be convicted of  any crime described  and charged by  the facts set out in  the information  irrespective of  the  characterization  of  the crime made by  the prosecuting officer.  The situation of the  accused  would not be  improved  by a conviction  of robbery with homicide rather than bandolerismo ."" It is alleged in the information in this case  that  said band, under the immediate  orders  and directions of the accused in this case, ""on the night of  the 15th of  April, 1906, entered the municipality of Malolos, Bulacan, attacked the quarters of the Constabulary at that place and killed three of its guards, wounded various soldiers,  captured a musician, Juan Palomo,  and stole twenty-three guns,  two revolvers, one thousand cartridges and a musical instrument, the property of said Constabulary and of the Insular Goverment.""  The facts alleged in  this information  were fully supported by the evidence  in  the  case.  Together they demonstrate beyond question or doubt that the accused and his band  are  guilty of the murder of the three soldiers referred to.   This fact makes it  unnecessary to determine the question presented by counsel for the reason  that that Act provides for the very case  in hand. The judgment of the court below  is founded in the facts and  is supported by the law and must be and is hereby affirmed, without special  finding as to costs. Arellano,  C.

HANDAN AMID, INAMA MORSAN, NICOLAS CARPIO ALIAS COLAS AMBAHANG MORO, DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N PER CURIAM: Moro Ambahang, Handan Amid (alias Rodolfo Enriquez), Inama Morsan,  Nicolas Carpio (alias Colas), and Sabturani Caponol, were charged in  the Court of First Instance of Zamboanga del Sur (in Crim. Case No.  723) with the crime of robbery in band with multiple murder and serious  physical injuries. On arraignment, they pleaded not guilty. After  trial, the court acquitted Sabturani Caponol, but convicted Moro  Ambahang, Handan Amid, Inama Morsan, and Nicolas Carpio, of the crime  charged, and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty of death, to  pay indemnity in the amount of P3,000.00 to the heirs of Tulawa Subano,  Dandolit Subano, Dodong Subana (a woman), and Nanibong Subana (a girl 9  years old), and P1,000.00 to Subanos Alobad and Inontong, and Subanas  Tuwawa, Tokling, and Felisa Juliana, and 1/5 of the costs. The case is now before us for review, pursuant to the provisions of Section 9, Rule 118, of the Rules of Court. The evidence clearly establish that at around 9 o'clock on the night of  May 18, 1956, a group of Subanos, more than 20 in number including women and children , were gathered at the house of Inontong Subana, at  Gogawanbugas, Ipil, Zamboanga del Sur, to discuss work (pintacasi) on  the following day. While they were discussing, the accused Handan Amid,  Inama Morsan, and Nicolas Carpio, suddenly appeared at the scene and  asked for Tulawa Subano. The accused Moro Ambahang remained under the  house. In answer to the query, Tulawa said: ""Here I am"". Thereupon,  Handan Amid, who was armed with a Japanese rifle (Similar to Exh. A),  fired at the former, hitting him at the breast and felling him. Handan  Amid then fired at the group, hitting Dandolit Subano, Dodong Subana,  Nanibong Subana, and others. The sudden and unexpected attack produced  consternation and confusion among the group, who started to scamper and  jump outside the house. The accused Inama Morsan and Nicolas Carpio,  both armed with sharp bolos, called ""barong"" similar to (Exhs. B and  C), slashed indiscriminately at the fleeing Subanos, wounding them  severely. Moro Ambahang, who was under the house armed with a rifle  (similar to Exh. D) fired at the fleeing Alobad Subano twice, hitting  the latter on his lap. The accused Sabturani Caponol was some 50 meters  away from the house. When Impos Subano, one of those who fled, passed  by him (Sabturani) while running to the bushes to hide, the latter  stood up and was about to chase the former. As a consequence  of the assault, 4 Subanos were killed, namely, Tulawa Subano, Dandolit  Subano, Dodong Subana, and Nanibong Subana—all victims of the  indiscriminate shooting by Handan Amid. The wounded victims, Tokling  Subana, Felisa Subana, Tuwawa Subana, Inontong Subano, and Alobad  Subano, suffered injuries as follows: (1) Tokling Subana: ""Incised wound, back 7"" long, 3 ½"" wide and 1 ½"" deep."" (Exh. G.) Treatment of the wound lasted more than 2 months. (2) Felisa Subana: ""1. Incised wound, left shoulder, 4"" long, 2 ½"" wide, and 1 ½"" deep. ""2. Incised wound, neck back, 6"" long, 3 ½"" wide, and 3"" deep."" (Exh. H.) Treatment of the wounds lasted more than 1 ½ months. (3) Tuwawa Subana: '1. Gun Shot, right leg, thru and thru."" (Exh. I.) Treatment  of the wound lasted nearly 1 month. But she sustained broken bones on  the injured part, for which reason, the duration of the treatment was  longer. Handaon Amid inflictetd the wound. (4) Inontong Subano: ""1. Incised wound, back, left, 6"" long, 3 ½"" wide, and 4 ½"" deep. ""2. Punctured wound, back, ½"" long, ¼"" wide, and 1"" deep."" (Exh. J.) Treatment of the wounds lasted from 25 to 30 days. Nicolas Carpio inflicted the wounds. (5) Alobad Subano: ""1. Incised wound, left elbow, 4"" long, 1 ½"" wide, 2"" deep. ""2, Incised wound, right arm, 6"" long, 3"" wide, and 2"" deep. ""3. Incised wound, left back, 1"" long, ½"" wide, and 1"" deep. ""4. Gun shot, left lap, thru and thru."" (Exh. K.) Treatment  of the wounds lasted more than 2 months. He sustained broken bones in  the elbows. Wounds were inflicted by Inama Morsan, Nicolas Carpio, and  Moro Ambahang. Impos  Subano, an inmate of the house and one of those who fled that night by  reason of the attack which took place, returned to the scene the  following morning. He saw the dead and wounded victims. He discovered  empty cartridge shells (Exhs. E, E-1, E-2, and E-3) and a live bullet  (Exh. F) inside the house. He also found out that their clothes and  things in the house were gone. Of his personal belongings, the  following were missing: 1 piece of drill cloth for trousers, valued at  P20.00; 1 white cloth (long piece) valued at P30.00; 1 turban worth  P60.00; and 1 gong which was shot at, valued at P80.00—all totalling  P190.00 He lost no time in informing the local authorities at Ipil  about the incident. Starting early in the morning of the following day  and running all the way along, he reached the municipal building of  Ipil at noon of the same day. He met the Chief of Police of Ipil and  related td him the incident. He was taken to the Justice of the Peace,  who interrogated him about the robbery. Thereafter, he went back to  Gogawanbugas to guide the police force that accompanied him to  investigate the crime and to seize the culprits. The latter had,  however, fled. The wounded were taken to the Zamboanga General Hospital  for treatment. Several weeks later, some of the accused  including Sabturani Caponel were arrested. Moro Ambahang and Nicolas  Carpio hid in a cave at Kamanga, Ipil. Guided by Sabturani Caponol, a  combined Philippine Constabulary and police force headed by the Chief  of Police, raided the hideout of said 2 accused in the afternoon. After  a brief exchange of fire, Nicolas Carpio was captured with his rifle  (Exh. A). Moro Ambahang was able to escape, but because of the police  authorities' relentless pursuit, he finally surrendered to the PC,  which confiscated from him a rifle (similar to Exh. D). The appellants interposed alibi as their only defense as follows: Handan Amid testified that he was in his house at Dalangin on the night of the  incident, with his wife and father-in-law; that he had never gone to  Gogawanbugas; and that he does not know the victims. Inama Morsan declared that on the night in question, he was in his house at Lawagan  and, therefore, could not have participated in the commission of the  crime. Nicolas Carpio stated that he was in his  house at Labason on the night of the killing; that he knows the  prosecution witnesses; and that they are his friends. Moro Ambahang averred that he did not participate in the execution of the offense;  that he was at Bacalan on the night of the incident; and that he does  not know the victims. The above testimonies of the appellants were not corroborated by any witness. As a rule, alibi is a week defense and cannot prevail over the positive  testimony of truthful witnesses. The reason is that it is easy of  fabrication. (People vs. Badilla, 48 Phil., 718; People vs. De Asis, 61 Phil., 384 People vs. Japitana, 77 Phil., 175.) Indeed, even in cases where proof of alibi is  well-supported by the testimony of witnesses, it would not be credited,  when the identity of the accused as the persons who committed the crime  is fully established by clear, explicit, and positive testimony, as in  the instant case. (U.S. vs. Pascua, 1 Phil., 631; U.S. vs. Hudieres, 27 Phil., 45.) We find appellants' alibi in this case to be weak and uncorroborated.  We agree with the lower court that ""living as they did within the  municipality of Ipil, it is not hard to conceive that they (accused)  could be present in their respective houses on the same day, or even on  the same night and within two hours appear at Gogawanbugas and commit  the dastardly act."" Said alibi, therefore, deserves no serious  consideration and must be disregarded. The identities of the  accused as the perpetrators of the crime were fully established by the  clear, explicit and positive testimony of the prosecution witnesses.  Nicolas Carpio was previously known to Alobad Subano because said  accused used to go to Alobad's house and ate there. As for Handan Amid  and Inama Morsari although they presented new faces to the group, yet  because of the light furnished by 3 kerosene lamps inside the house,  they were distinctly and positively recognized and identified by their  victims. Thus, Alobad Subano, Tokling Subano, Tuwawa Subano, Inontong  Subano and Impos Subano identified the appellants, Inama Morsan, Handan  Amid, and Nicolas Carpio, as the trio who went up the house and  attacked them treacherously and mercilessly. Moro Ambahang was .fully  identified by prosecution witnesses Impos Subano and Mariano Tulawe.  The first testified that, although he did not know the name of Moro  Ambahang before, he had met him prior to the incident in a place called  Bantayan. So, during the commission of the crime, he recognized him by  the light of the moon, as it was then moonlight night. Mariano Tulawe  also declared that when he went down from his house which is near  Inontong's house, to find out the cause of the commotion there, he saw  Moro Ambahang at the stairs of said house, holding a rifle, and moments  later, he again saw him (Moro Ambahang) in the act of shooting at  Alobad. This testimony is also corroborated by Impos Subano's statement. It is a matter of common experience that victims of violence strive to  know the identity of their assailants. As aptly observed by the trial  court, said victims were the subject of extraordinary pressure or  stress, and the occurrence is consequently impressed on their minds  like red-hot iron. Indeed, such a harrowing experience as that which  the prosecution witnesses went through during that fateful night of May  18, 1956, must have seared into their memories as to enable said  witnesses to point without hesitation, to the appellants as the  perpetrators of the crime with which they have been charged. There is absolutely no showing as to any possible motive on the part of  the prosecution witnesses that could have impelled them to testify  falsely against the appellants. We agree with the Solicitor General  that being aware of the gravity of the crime charged and the severe  penalty which may be meted out to the appellants, should they be  convicted of the offense charged, said prosecution witnesses would have  recoiled from pointing to the former as the malefactors, unless they  were certain of the truth. Appellants, however, contend that  there was no proof of robbery in this case and, therefore, the  application of Article 296 of the Revised Penal Code, by the trial  court, is erroneous. There is merit in the contention. In  arriving at the conclusion that the appellants committed the robbery  imputed to them, the trial court considered the lone uncorroborated  testimony of Impos Subano that when he returned to the scene of the  killing the following morning, he found their clothes and things in the  house, including his personal belongings already gone. On the basis of  his testimony, the court stated that ""although he (Impos Subano) did  not see who stole said things, it is presumed that the accused carried them away at night when everybody scampered for safety."" It will be observed that the conclusion of the trial court is  predicated, not on substantial evidence, but purely on mere  presumptions. This, in our opinion, is not sufficient to sustain a  conviction of the crime charged. It has been held that when a person is  charged with robbery, the intent to rob (which is intent of gain) must  be proven. (U.S. vs. Villorente, et al., 30 Phil., 59; People vs. Barruga, 61 Phil., 318). This necessarily includes evidence to the  effect that the accused carried away the effects or personalty of the  offended party. In the instant case, there is absence of proof that the  appellants, on the night in question, did intend to rob the house of  Inontong Subano. There is, likewise, total want of evidence that the  appellants were the ones who carried away the things in said house. [1] In the absence of such evidence, we can not in conscience hold that the  appellants had committed robbery on the night in question. Appellants, also, argue that there was no evidence of conspiracy to  justify the imposition of the penalty on all of them, irrespective of  the extent or nature of their individual participation in the  commission of the crime. There is no merit in the  contention. It has been repeatedly held by this Court that direct proof  is not essential to show conspiracy. [2] If it is proved that two or more persons aimed by their acts towards  the accomplishment of the same unlawful object, each doing a part so  that their acts, though apparently independent, were in fact connected  and cooperative, indicating a closeness of personal association and a  concurrence of sentiment, a conspiracy may be inferred though no actual  meeting among them to concert is proved. (People vs. Carbonel,  48 Phil., 868.) We agree with the trial court that ""the mere fact that  the appellants were together all armed, and almost simultaneously  attacked the victims upon the firing of a shot by one of them aimed  directly at Tulawa Subano, clearly indicates that unity of purpose  which is an unmistakable sign of conspiracy."" Conspiracy having been  established, appellants are equally guilty of, and liable for, the  crimes committed. Accordingly, we find appellants guilty of  the crime of murder (for the killing of the 4 Subanos), qualified by  treachery, as the attack was sudden and unexpected. [3] In the victims who were unarmed, thereby insuring the execution of the  crime without risk to appellants from the defense which said victims  might have made; and serious physical injuries (for the wounding of the  5 Subanos). The aggravating circumstances of band and dwelling,  attended the commission of both crimes. Although the  mitigating circumstance of lack of instruction may be considered in  favor of the appellants who are unschooled, the same would not alter  the result considering that 2 aggravating circumstances attended the  commission of said crimes. Pursuant to law [4] and the applicable jurisprudence, [5] we hereby impose upon each of the appellants four (4) penalties of  death (for the murder of 4 victims) and five (5) penalties of prision correccional (for the serious physical injuries caused to 5 victims). Modified as above indicated, the decision of the trial court is in all  respects affirmed, with costs against the appellants. It is so ordered. Paras, C.

PORCIUNCULA, ALIAS MAAY), ANAS-TACIO BORJA Y GUILLERA (ALIAS TATING) , JUAN SUSAYA Y CORBIL, AND RICARDO QUILAQUIL Y BORDAJE, APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N REYES, J.: At about 7:30 o'clock in the evening of April 11,  1946, Pedro Porciuncula, a tobacco merchant, was shot to death at his  office in his house on Ramon Fernandez Street, City of Manila, where he  and his wife and children were then living. He received four gunshot  wounds: one through the head, another through the chest, and two  through the right arm. Questioned by the police, the  deceased man's wife, Emiliana Go, gave the information that her husband  had been shot by two unknown persons, and while professing ignorance of  the killer's true motive, she made the hint that, because her husband  had three queridas , one of them might have been ""instrumental"" in having him killed. The crime was solved with the arrest of four suspects: Anastacio Borja,  Juan Susaya, Ricardo Quilaquil, and Erlinda Carson. The four gave  signed statements admitting their participation in a conspiracy to kill  the deceased and at the same time implicating his widow. Also  implicated were three others, who, though not captured, were identified  as Felipe Tumandao, Filemon Salcedo, and Marciano Peras. The police was  also able to recover the written instrument by which the widow gave  formal approval to the conspiracy. The police found the original copy  of the document in the army cot of Filemon Salcedo in the house of Juan  Susaya on Galicia Street, Sampaloc, Manila, a carbon copy thereof in  another part of the same house, and still another copy in the trunk of  Anastacio Borja at his residence on Lepanto Street. Referred to in the  record as the ""murder contract,"" the instrument reads as follows: ""April 3, 1946 ""To whom it may concern: ""I, Emiliana Go y Porciuncula, 25 years, married, of 2508 R. Fernandez,  Tondo, Manila with my own consent have agreed with Felix Lopez  regarding the shooting of my husband (Pedro Porciuncula, 31 years,  married, of the same address) for the following reasons: ""1. He is living with another woman. ""2. He always torture me when he comes home from the house of his woman. ""3. I can't withstand his treatment to me. ""Felix and I, have written the following agreement: ""1. That I will give Felix Lopez P10,000 on installment basis. ""2. That I gave him P6,000 cash. ""3. That after the killing of my husband, I will completely give him the rest of the amount. ""4. That I will answer everything for him. ""5. That if something may happen to him, do not do something, instead look for me. ""6. In other words, I will take all the responsibility, in case something may happen to him. ""Witnesses: ""JUANITO SUSAYA ""ANASTACIO BORJA ""Thumbmark: ( Here two thumbmarks ) ""Signed By: ""EMILIANA G. PORCIUNCULA ""This 4th day of April 1946 ""Thumbmark:"" ( Here one thumbmark) Confronted  with the above document, Emiliana Go and Anastacio Borja admitted their  signatures and thumbmarks thereon, while Juan Susaya, on his part,  said that the document was signed and thumbmarked for him by his  common-law wife in his presence. Erlinda Carson confessed to having  typed the document from a draft signed by Emiliana Go, Anastacio Borja,  and Juan Susaya, and she also divulged that the Felix Lopez therein  mentioned was no other than her common-law husband, Filemon Salcedo,  who, not wishing his name to appear in the contract, had asked to be  designated by another name. On the strength of the facts thus  revealed and of other proofs unearthed by the police, an information  was filed in the Court of First Instance of Manila, charging Emiliana  Go alias Maay, with parricide and her co-defendants Anastacio Borja  ( alias Tating), Juan Susaya, Ricardo Quilaquil, Erlinda Carson, Filemon  Salcedo ( alias Felix Lopez), Felipe Tumandao, and Marciano Peras, with  murder, the information alleging— ""That on or about the 11th day of April, 1946, and for some time prior  thereto, in the City of Manila, Philippines, the said Emiliana Go alias Emiliana G. Porciuncula alias Mrs. Porciuncula alias Maay did then and  there willfully, unlawfully, feloneously and directly induce her  co-accused, the said Anastacio Borja y Guillera alias Tating, Juan  Susaya y Corbil, Ricardo Quilaquil y Bordaje, Erlinda Carson y Ador,  Filemon Salcedo alias Felix Lopez, Felipe Tumandao and Marciana Peras,  to kill Pedro Porciuncula, her own husband, by paying them in advance a  big amount of money and promising to pay them an additional large sum  after the killing; and that on or about said day, April 11, 1946; in  said city, the said Anastacio Borja y Guillera alias Tating, Juan  Susaya y Corbil, Ricardo Quilaquil y Bordaje, Erlinda Carson y Ador,  Filemon Salcedo alias Felix Lopez, Felipe Tumandao and Marciano Peras,  with intent to kill in consideration of the price and promise of an  additional price or reward as above set forth, during night time  purposely sought, with evident premeditation and treachery in that the  attack was sudden and unexpected, conspiring with the, said Emiliana Go alias Emiliana G. Porciuncula alias Mrs. Porciuncula alias Maay and  with one another and mutually helping each other, did then and there  willfully, unlawfully and feloniously attack and assault the said Pedro  Porciuncula by shooting him repeatedly with firearms, thereby  inflicting upon him mortal wounds which were the direct and immediate  cause of his instantaneous death."" With the defendants Salcedo, Tumandao, and Peras still at large, the  case came up for trial with respect to the other accused, all of whom  pleaded not guilty, with the exception of Erlinda Carson, who had to be  discharged from the information so that she could be used as a state  witness. Emiliana Go moved for a separate trial, but the motion was  denied, and she was tried jointly with Anastacio Borja, Juan Susaya,  and Hicardo Quilaquil. She, however, had her own separate counsel, who  conducted her defense independently of the others. The evidence shows that Emiliana Go's married life with the deceased Pedro Porciuncula was far from being a happy one. Embittered as it already was by their petty quarrels and his illicit affairs with other women , it was made well-nigh unbearable by his frequent outbursts of temper in the course of which he would lay hands on his wife and give her a good thrashing. Unable to endure her misery any longer, Emiliana in her desperation decided to eliminate her husband, and to that end she appealed to her cousin Anastacio Borja to look for someone who would do the job. Sympathizing with his relative and making common cause with her, Borja contracted Juan Susaya and the latter's housemate Filemon Salcedo (whom he knew to be a hold-upper) and introduced the two to Emiliana in her house in Gagalangin. After several days' negotiation an understanding was reached, with Emiliana agreeing to pay P10,000 for the killing of her husband and to assume all responsibility therefor. The agreement was reduced to writing, typed by Salcedo's common-law wife, Erlinda Carson, and then signed and thumbmarked by Emiliana and Borja and also by Susaya's common-law wife with his name and in his presence. To carry out the planned assassination of Pedro Porciuncula, Salcedo  first recruited Ricardo Quilaquil, took him along to Emiliana to ask  for transportation expenses, and then, with him and Susaya and one  Pedro Castillo, set out in a jeep in the early morning of April 11,  1946, Ixmnd for the house of the intended victim.    But on the way they happened to be stopped and searched by a police patrol at the  corner of Tayuman and Juan Luna Streets, and Quilaquil and Castillo  were arrested, Quilaquil for carrying a .45—caliber pistol and Castillo  for carrying a balisong. Quilaquil remained in confinement until the  afternoon of the following day. Temporarily thwarted but still bent on performing his end of the  bargain, Salcedo recruited two new companions (Marciano Peras and  Felipe Tumandao) and in the evening of the same day (April 11) went  with them on a jeep to the residence of the deceased. There Salcedo and  Peras left Tumandao in the vehicle as guard, entered the house through  the back door and, with Emiliana to guide them, went into the room  where the deceased was, shot him to death and then fled. With the murder accomplished, Salcedo sent Erlinda to Emiliana's house  to collect from her the price agreed upon. Knowing that Erlinda was in  the conspiracy, Emiliana confided to her how the murderers had entered  through the kitchen door and been led by her to the room of the  deceased, and after showing her the bullet marks and blood stains  therein she took her to her own room and handed her the sum of P2,150,  explaining that it was all the cash she had but promising to pay the  balance on May 10. The money was divided between Salcedo, Susaya,  Quilaquil, and five others. The evidence further shows that previous to the murder of her husband,  Emiliana had been making threats to have him killed. Thus Rodolfo  Penaflor, who was bookkeeper and secretary of the deceased and lived  with the spouses, testified that he often heard Emiliana utter such  threats. And according to Telesfora Porciuncula, sister-in-law of the  deceased, Emiliana complained to her shortly before the murder that the  deceased had quarreled with her and that for that reason she was going  home to her province, but warning that he would yet have ""his day"" for  she would have him killed before she left.   Brigido Porciuncula, brother of the deceased, also testified that when, after Emiliana's  arrest, he visited her in jail and informed her that he had seen the  murder contract, and then asked her why she went through with it, she  broke into tears and said: ""Forgive me for what I have committed."" Testifying in her own defense, Emiliana denied having had anything to  do with the murder of her husband. She admitted signing the murder  contract, but alleged that she did so without reading it and without  knowing its contents, Filemon Salcedo having assured her that it was  merely a contract for the services of a lawyer who was to work for her  separation from her husband. She denied having given or promised to  give money to any of her co-defendants and even denied having known  some of them. She, however, gave to understand that she was not happy  with her husband, her life with him having been made miserable by his  infidelity and by their frequent quarrels in the course of which he  would beat her up even to the extent of crippling her and causing her  to spit blood. She said that on one occasion he threw a pair of shoes  at her, thereby inflicting upon her lower lip a laceration which had to  be sutured in the hospital. She claimed that she still cherished his  memory, but she also made it plain that life with him had become so  unbearable that she conceived the idea of separating from him. And then  she admitted that although Erlinda Carson had told her of SaJcedo's  complicity in the murder of her husband four or five days after it took  place, yet she made no mention of it to the police, this despite the  fact that she sometimes went to the detective bureau to find out who  had killed her husband. The other appellants, namely, Anastacio Borja, Ricardo Quilaquil, and  Juan Susaya, all denied participation in the murder plot and claimed  that their confessions had been extracted from them through force and violence . Borja did admit signing the murder contract, but claimed that he did so  only after Salcedo had maltreated him and threatened him with death. He  would make it appear that the said contract was not a murder plot, that  it was signed by him after the killing, and that Salcedo informed him  that he was merely going to use it to blackmail Emiliana. He said that  he did not know the contents of the document and that although he had a  copy of it he never read it. He admitted having introduced Salcedo to  Emiliana, claiming, however, that the incident was purely accidental,  for while talking to Emiliana on that occasion he happened to see  Salcedo pass by. But he also admitted that although he had learned from  Salcedo that Porciuncula had been the victim of a foul play he neither  informed Emiliana about it nor reported it to the police. It appears  that Borja was a first year high school student. Ricardo Quilaquil on his part testified that he did not know the  deceased Pedro Porciuncula or his widow Emiliana Go and came to know  Anastacio Borja only in Bilibid. He said that he could not have taken  part in the killing because at the time it happened he was in jail,  having been detained for illegal possession of a firearm from the  afternoon of April 10 up to the following day. But he admitted that  among his companions in the jeep when he was arrested on that occasion  were Filemon Salcedo, Juan Susaya, and Pedro Castillo, though  explaining that he was then on his way to Navotas to sell his firearm. The defendant Juan Susaya also put up an alibi, saying that from 8  o'clock in the morning of the day in question he was in an army camp  where he was working as a cook. He admitted that Filemon Salcedo and  his wife were living in his house, and referring to the incident when  with Salcedo and Quilaquil he was detained by the police in the  afternoon of April 10, he said that he happened to be with Salcedo then  because on his way to the camp he was invited by Salcedo to ride with  him in the jeep and he accepted the invitation because he had nothing  else to do. He denied having entered into any plot to murder Pedro  Porciuncula or having received any money in that connection. On the foregoing evidence the trial court found Emiliana Go guilty of  parricide and her co-defendants Anastacio Borja, Juan Susaya, and  Ricardo Quilaquil guilty of murder, sentencing all of them to suffer  each the penalty of reclusion perpetua , jointly and severally to  indemnify the heirs of the deceased in the sum of P2,000, without  subsidiary imprisonment in case of insolvency, and each to pay  one-eighth of the costs. The three defendants last named were declared  entitled to be credited with one-half of the preventive imprisonment  undergone by them. From this sentence the defendants have appealed,  with defendant Emiliana Go presenting a separate brief. Taking up first the appeal of Emiliana Go, we find that this defendant  contends in the first place that the trial court erred in not granting  her a separate trial. As a matter of law the granting of a separate  trial when two or more defendants are jointly charged with an offense  is discretionary with the trial court (Sec. 8, Rule 115). But it is  claimed that judicial discretion was abused in this case when Emiliana  Go was denied separate trial because her defense was antagonistic to  that of her co-defendants, some of whom had made confessions  implicating her in the crime. We find, however, that defendants did not  as a matter of fact put an antagonistic defenses, and there is no  reason to believe that Emiliana Go has suffered substantial prejudice  from the fact that she was tried jointly with her co-defendants. It is contended that because of the denial of a separate trial for  Emiliana Go, evidence that was competent only against her  co-defendants, consisting of their extrajudicial confessions, helped  in convincing the trial court that she conspired with them to kill her  husband. But it would appear from the record that the trial judge had  been forwarned about the incompetency of said evidence as against Emiliana and that he obviously took heed of it in his order denying the  petition for separate trial. And in any event, while those confessions  were not admissible as against Emiliana Go as proof of a specific fact,  they could nevertheless, because of their materiality, be taken into  consideration as a circumstance in judging the testimony of one of the  conspirators, Erlinda Carson (People vs. Badilla, 48 Phil., 718).     Said this court in that case: ""* * * The general rule is that extrajudicial declarations of a  co-conspirator made before the formation of the conspiracy or after the  accomplishment of its object, are inadmissible in evidence against the  other co-conspirators, on the ground that the accused in a criminal  case has the constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and to cross-examine them. It has however, been held that  where extrajudicial confessions had been made by several persons  charged with a conspiracy and there could have been no collusion with  reference to the several confessions, the fact that the statements are  in all material respects identical is confirmatory of the testimony of  an accomplice. It was so held in the case of United States vs. Lancaster (44 Fed. 896), where three persons were jointly charged with  a conspiracy, one of whom made a voluntary confession, another was  permitted to become a witness for the Government under implied pardon  and testified, and the third made a declaration during the pendency of  the criminal enterprise, the court saying among other things that '* *  * while the testimony of the two accomplices could not corroborate each  other, and while the confession of Clemens cannot be considered as  evidence against the other prisoners, yet the unanimity of statements  of the three, made without the opportunity of conference, is a fact  which tends to corroborate the three statements so made. * * *.' ""In other words while an extrajudicial declaration of a co-conspirator  may not be directly introduced in evidence against another  co-conspirator as proof of specific facts, it may nevertheless under  certain conditions be taken into consideration as a circumstance in  judging the credibility of the testimony of an accomplice."" (People vs. Badilla, 48 Phil., 718, 725-726.) We find, moreover, that independently of the above confessions there is  ample proof on record upon which the conviction of Emiliana Go could be  based. In the first place, there is the murder contract itself, which  Emiliana Go admits to have signed and which speaks for itself. Her  explanation that she never read it is too improbable to be believed. Then there is the testimony of Erlinda Carson that when she visited Emiliana after the murder, the latter described  to her how the murder was committed and how she had guided Salcedo to  her husband's room, even showing her the bullet marks and blood stains  therein; and that Emiliana gave her P2,150 as part payment of the price  agreed upon for the killing, which sum she later delivered to the  triggerman Filemon Salcedo. There is also the testimony of Rodolfo  Penaflor that he often heard Emiliana making threats to have her  husband killed. And significant is the fact that when Brigido  Porciuncula, brother of the deceased, visited her in jail and asked her  why she went through with the contract to have her husband killed, she  broke into tears and asked forgiveness for what she had done. In  addition, there is the existence of a strong motive on her part for  getting rid of her husband, discernible from her own account of her  unhappy married life. And her admission that, though she had  information that Salcedo was the one who killed her husband, she said  nothing about it to the police, clearly belies her protestation that  she was innocent of the whole affair. The rest of the assignments of error of this appellant deals with the  findings of fact of the trial court and in the final analysis their  resolution hinges on the credibility of the witnesses. But after  carefully going over the record we find nothing that would justify the  conclusion that the trial court has not made a correct appreciation of  their testimony. The declaration of the state witness Erlinda Carson is assailed on the  ground that it conflicts in some of its details with her extrajudicial  confession. But while contradictions do exist between her two  declarations the same may have been due merely to her imperfect memory  in matters of detail and, as the Solicitor General suggests, also to  ""the lengthy cross-examination to which she was subjected by a renowned  and justly feared criminal lawyer."" But the contradictions in  important parts have been satisfactorily explained by her and on the whole her statements agree as to the main and ultimate facts. Turning now to the appeal of Anastacio Borja, Juan Susaya, and Ricardo  Quilaquil, we find that the case against them is even stronger. For  aside from the testimony of Erlinda Carson and the murder contract we  have their extrajudicial statements admitting their participation in  the conspiracy to kill the deceased. It is immaterial that these  appellants took no direct part in the execution of the criminal act or  lent no cooperation in its commission by another act without which the  crime could not have been accomplished. Once conspiracy is proved, each  and every one of the co-conspirators must answer for the acts of the  others, provided such acts are the result of the common plan or  purpose. (People vs. Maasin, 64 Phil., 757.) It does not appear that  these appellants had withdrawn from the conspiracy or ever made any  attempt not to have it carried out. On the contrary, the acceptance by  all of them, with the exception of Anastacio Borja, of a share in the  price paid for the murder after this had been consummated, as appears  in their confessions, would belie any claim that they ever desisted  from the unlawful enterprise. As to Borja, it would appear that this  defendant received money from Emiliana before the murder; but we have  his admission that, though he had learned from Salcedo who the murderer  was, yet he did nothing to have the authorities informed about it. This  denotes continued interest in the success of the conspiracy of which he  was, according to one of his co-defendants, the real ""master mind."" After going over the record, it is our conclusion that the trial court  was justified in finding the appellants guilty as charged, and as the  sentence imposed is in accordance with law, the same is hereby  affirmed, with costs.

R. No. 16443. March 21, 1921 ] THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. MARTINA RIVERA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N MALCOLM, J.: When Leona Laciste endeavored to set fire to  the house of Martina Rivera in which the two small children of the  latter were sleeping, the two women grappled and Leona Laciste was  boloed to death by Martina Rivera. As a result, a criminal prosecution  for murder was instituted in the Court of First Instance of La Union against Martina Rivera and after due trial she was found guilty of the  lesser crime of homicide and was sentenced to eight years and one day  of prision mayor , with the accessory penalties provided by  article 61 of the Penal Code, to indemnify the heirs of the deceased in  the sum of P500, and to pay the costs. Two questions are raised by the appeal. The one more  fundamental in nature revolves about the point of whether or not the  defendant should be exempted from all responsibility because of having  acted in defense of her person, her rights, and her descendants. The  second question is incidental in nature and relates to the finding of  the court that the qualifying circumstance of cruelty, because of  having deliberately and inhumanly increased the sufferings of the  offended party, was present. Article 8 of the Penal Code exempts any one from criminal liability  who acts in defense of his person or rights, provided that the  following circumstances concur: (1) Unlawful aggression; (2) reasonable  necessity for the means employed to prevent or repel it; (3) lack of  sufficient provocation on the part of the person defending himself.  Anyone who acts in defense of the person of his descendant is similarly  exempted. In our view of the case, the first and last requisites  above-mentioned concur, but the second is lacking. A man's house is his castle. When a person is attacked in his own  house, he has a right to protect it, and those within it, from the  intrusion or attack. He may repel force by force in defense of person,  habitation, or property, against one who manifestly intends or  endeavors by violence or surprise to commit a felony, such as arson,  upon either. In such case one is not obliged to retreat, but may pursue  his adversary until he has secured himself from danger. (People vs. Lewis [1897], 117 Cal., 186, citing East's Pleas of the Crown, p. 271,  and Foster's Crown Cases, chapter 3, p. 273, where the rule is well  stated.) In this instance, the accused acted in defense of her person, her  home, and her children . The crime of arson was about to be committed,  and there was present the element of danger to the occupants of the  habitation. But there was not present any reasonable necessity for  killing the assailant. The accused proceeded beyond the limits of  immunity when, after the assailant was out of the house, and prostrate  on the ground, she persisted in wounding her no less than fourteen  times. The case is, consequently, covered by article 86 of the Penal  Code. The lower court committed an error in taking into consideration the  qualifying circumstance of cruelty. The number of wounds on the body of  a deceased are not conclusive evidence of the presence of this  circumstance. (U. S. vs. Palermo [1915], 31 Phil., 425;  decision of the Supreme Court of Spain of December 9, 1889.) On the  contrary, the evidence discloses more nearly the mitigating  circumstance of passion and obfuscation. It is our unmistakable duty to find the defendant guilty of  homicide. It is, however, just as certainly our duty to view with  leniency the action of the defendant in view of the provocative nature  of the aggression. The provisions of article 86 of the Penal Code  permit of the exercise of considerable discretion by the courts. Judgment is affirmed, with the modification that in place of eight years and one day of prision mayor, the defendant and appellant shall be sentenced to three years of prision correccional, and shall, in addition, pay the costs of this instance. So ordered. Mapa, C. J., Araudio, Street, and Villamor, JJ., concur. Source: Supreme Court E-Library |","[ G. R. No. 16443. March 21, 1921 ] THE UNITED STATES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS.

R. No. 33795. September 04, 1931 ] ALEIDA SAAVEDRA, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLANT,  VS.  CEFERINO YBAÑEZ ESTRADA, DEFENDANT AND APPELLEE. D E C I S I O N STREET, J.: This  action was instituted in the Court of First Instance of Cebu by Aleida Saavedra against her husband, Ceferino Ybañez Estrada. The purpose of the complaint is to secure a judgment for  maintenance for the plaintiff and her children from the defendant, who is her husband, and to obtain an order requiring him to  pay such maintenance not only in the  future but for a period in the past, beginning in 1920, during which the  defendant has contributed nothing for the support of his  family.  The petitory  part of the complaint asks  for other incidental relief consisting of an accounting, and  a writ of injunction to prohibit the defendant, his attorneys, agents and representatives from selling, mortgaging, or in any manner transferring the property pertaining to the conjugal partnership,  without express authorization from the court. Upon hearing the  cause the trial court entered an order requiring the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of P200 per month beginning September, 1929, the date of the filing of this action, and  ending with the month of March,  1930, when  this decision was promulgated, after which he required the defendant to pay, in future installments, a monthly stipend of P200, and further to reimburse the plaintiff in the amount of P2,000 for  attorneys' fees, and the costs  of the action.   From this  judgment  the plaintiff appealed. The parties in this case are husband and wife, who were married in January,  1904, in Dumaguete, Oriental Negros. As  a result of their marriage nine children have been born, three of whom are dead and six living.  Two of the living children are already  of age, namely, Manuel and Gabriela. The other four are still minors, living with their mother. In the course of their marriage a large amount of land has been  acquired,  consisting  of  over  400 hectares of land, which property was  at the time of the institution of  this action stocked  with  several  hundred head  of cattle,—all property of the conjugal partnership. The married life of the spouses appears not to have been happy,  owing to  the loose morals  and violent disposition of the defendant and his frequent and persistent mistreatment of his wife.  In order to escape from his abuse, the plaintiff was compelled in 1914 to take refuge with all her children in the house of a neighbor.  Upon promise upon the part of the husband to mend his ways, marital life  was resumed towards the end of the same year.   Four years later, while the plaintiff was enceinte with her  ninth child, the defendant treated her with personal violence , and she was compelled to  remove herself from contact with him by obtaining accommodations for herself and all her children in the San Jose asylum in Cebu.  She there remained for some time under the care of the sisters of charity, giving birth to her last child.  Finally, about September, 1920, the plaintiff was forced to present a civil action seeking an order requiring the defendant to supply maintenance for herself  and children , but in  1926 the defendant prevailed upon her to dismiss said action upon his  promise to  supply her needs. This promise was not kept; and for more than a decade this woman has struggled alone maintaining her family as best she could by obtaining credit from strangers and sacrificing paraphernal property of her own. Worst of all, from a marital point of view, the defendant has been in the  habit of using the servant women around his place as mistresses, and he has a child by a woman who was his servant  in years past.  At the time this  case was tried, he was in illicit relations with another servant.   This course of conduct has made cohabitation between the plaintiff and defendant a moral impossibility. The first error assigned by the appellant is directed to the failure  of his Honor, the trial judge, to allow the amount of P330 per month  for the plaintiff's expenses,  from the date of the filing of the complaint, in taking care of herself and the four children who are  dependent upon  her.  As already stated, only P200 per month was allowed  for these expenses, and we are of the opinion that  the estimate of the trial court was too conservative.   The plaintiff specified in detail the items deemed absolutely necessary to defray her expenses, and these  items are, in our opinion, within the bounds of  strict economy.  There is nothing claimed for luxuries or extravagances, such as automobile hire, salary of chauffeur, telephone rent, and the  like.  The ages  of the children at the  time this  action was  tried were between 10 and 16 or 17 years, that is to say, they were then arriving at the age  when expenses for schooling, clothing, and other necessary items  are  beginning to make  themselves felt in the family.  On  the other hand, the value of the community property is considerable, consisting of a large hacienda with many thousand coconut trees  in bearing and several hundred head of cattle and carabao, worth all together around P100,000.  We think that the allowance of the full amount claimed,  or P330 per month,  since the institution of this action, as well as for the future, is a proper allowance, and the judgment will be modified accordingly. The second error  is directed to the failure of the lower court to award judgment for past due maintenance accruing under a preliminary order in  case No. 3335, effective September, 1920, and running until the present action  was instituted.   In this connection it appears that an order for maintenance pendente lite was entered by the trial court in that case, and nothing has ever been paid upon said account. Nevertheless it appears that,  on  May 21, 1926, the herein plaintiff, also plaintiff in case No. 3335, caused said action to be dismissed, in reliance upon the defendant's promises. The dismissal of  said  case necessarily  had the  effect of abrogating the order for  maintenance pendente  lite , and placed the plaintiff in a position where she is unable to enforce that  order.   An  order pendente  lite is in its very nature contingent, and the dismissal of the action had the effect of abrogating the order. It appears, however, that as a result of the failure of the defendant  to pay said maintenance under  the  order  referred to, the present plaintiff has been compelled to incur debts for the maintenance of herself and family, and to pay these debts, so far as they have been paid, she has been compelled  to sacrifice valuable  paraphernal  property  under authority granted by the court.  The  amount which  the plaintiff has been compelled to disburse in this way, and the value of the paraphernal property sacrificed, or obligations incurred, have not been proved; and while it is  obvious that the defendant is under an obligation to reimburse the plaintiff for these outlays and sacrifices, we are not in a position  to give her  relief  as  to  such items, under  the prayer of the present complaint.  But the order hereinafter made for the affirmance  of the judgment in this respect will be made without prejudice to her right hereafter, by independent action,  or  in the ultimate liquidation of the conjugal estate, to be reimbursed as to the  matters  mentioned. The third error is directed to the failure of the  court to concede to the plaintiff an  accounting of the income received by the defendant from  the property of the  conjugal partnership; and she seeks judgment for her share therein. We are unable to see  the necessity for such an accounting, as it will be more appropriate in the liquidation of  the conjugal  estate. The fourth assignment of  the appellant is directed to the supposed error of the trial court in refusing  to grant to the plaintiff an injunction to restrain him and his agents from  alienating the  conjugal property without the permission of the court.  The proof undoubtedly  shows a  situation where the plaintiff and her children are in danger  of being embarrassed  or defrauded by possible  future acts of the defendant in  alienating the conjugal property, unless some step  is taken to protect  their interest.   The majority of the court, however,  are  of the  opinion  that the proper method to accomplish this is for the plaintiff to cause to be noted upon the registry of property, as she is hereby authorized to do, the fact  that  the  conjugal property is subject to the rights of the  plaintiff to future maintenance at the rate of P330 per month, payable out of said property or its proceeds  (Baello vs. Villanueva and Villanueva,  54  Phil., 213) ; and although  the record before us does not contain a description of the  property  sufficient to make the proper order here, the trial court will be directed to make the proper order for the  annotation  of this lien, upon proof,  if necessary,  to be submitted by the plaintiff. It being understood, therefore, first, that the amount of maintenance accruing to the plaintiff from the date of the institution of this action is at the rate of P330 per month, amounting to P7,920, to  the  date of the promulgation of this decision,  which  amount the  defendant is directed to pay to  the plaintiff; secondly, that  from and after this date she is entitled to recover the sum of P330 per month, which the defendant is ordered to  pay into court on or before the 10th day of each month, beginning October, 1931; thirdly, that the plaintiff is entitled to have the encumbrance indicated in this right to maintenance inscribed on the registry of property; and,  fourthly, that this judgment is without prejudice to the right of the  plaintiff to be reimbursed for any amount, or amounts, which she may have expended from the proceeds of her paraphernal property, or for which she may have become indebted upon account of the  necessary maintenance of herself and children prior to the bringing of this action, the judgment appealed from, as thus modified, is affirmed.

No. 23792. February 17, 1926 ] THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE VS. .  SEGUNDO BADILLA  ET  AL., DEFENDANTS AND APPELLANTS. D E C I S I O N OSTRAND, J.: In the evening of March  7,  1924, Pedro Ferrer, justice of the peace of the  municipality of Sagay, Occidental  Negros,  was  fatally wounded in the house of one  Leocadia Desamparado,  who  stated  that she had inflicted  the fatal wound in  defense  of her  honor.  She  was immediately arrested and two days later, while still in prison, made  a confession  implicating Segundo Badilla, Restituto Tupas, Julian Domingo, Quirino Araez, and Jovito Carmales in the commission of the crime.  The  persons mentioned  were thereupon arrested and on the following day,  March 10, Julian Domingo and  Jovito Carmales confessed that they were participants in  the crime and on the same day, the provincial fiscal filed a complaint in the court of  the justice of the peace of Sagay charging Segundo Badilla, Restituto Tupas, Catalino Gonzalez, Julian Domingo, Jovito Carmales, Quirino Araez, Agaton Dy-Cayco, and Leocadia Desamparado with the crime of murder. On March 12 an amended complaint was filed including Epifanio  Tupas  as  one  of the defendants.  At the preliminary investigation held on the same day, the fiscal presented a motion asking that Leocadia  Desamparado and Jovito Carmales be excluded from  the  complaint on the ground that they were the least culpable of the accused and that their testimony was neccessary to establish a  case for the prosecution.  This motion was granted by the acting justice of the peace.  Upon the termination of the preliminary investigation, the following information was filed in the Court of First Instance: ""That on and before March  7, 1924, the defendants Epifanio Tupas, Segundo Badilla, Restituto Tupas, and Agaton Dy-Cayco in connivance with  one Leocadia Desamparado, Jovito Carmales and their codefendants Catalino Gonzalez alias Mack Gonzales,  Julian Domingo alias Julian Bongol, and Quirino Araez, all said  defendants  being members of a local secret society known as Kusug Sang Imol desiring to take revenge  for  supposed abuses  and arbitrary acts of the justice of the peace Pedro  Ferrer of the municipality of Sagay of  this  Province of Occidental Negros, in connection with his official functions, of which they believed without any  ground that the  defendants Epifanio Tupas and his son Restituto Tupas, specially, and Epifanio Tupas, Restituto  Tupas,  Segundo Badilla, Agaton Dy-Cayco and all the defendants herein had been the victims, being active members,  as they are, of the aforesaid society Kusug Sang Imol, and  desiring likewise the death of said justice of the peace Pedro Ferrer to eliminate him  from the office by any illicit means, so that he should not continue to commit similar supposed abuses and arbitrary acts, said defendants Epifanio Tupas, his son Restituto Tupas, Segundo  Badilla, and Agaton Dy-Cayco did maliciously, intentionally and criminally induce said Leocadia Desamparado,  by simulat ing that she had to legalize her marital relations with her paramour Jose Lobaton which they had been maintaining up to that  time, to invite the justice of the peace Pedro Ferrer to  spend some time in  her house situated in the municipality of Sagay, Province of Occidental Negros, Philippine Islands, just on the night of said March  7,  1924, which inducement  was several times and  on  several occasions ratified persistently by the defendants Epifanio Tupas, Segundo Badilla, Restituto Tupas and Agaton Dy-Cayco,  with promise of reward, immunity and assurance to furnish her an attorney who would defend her in the event that by reason of her  taking part in the perpetration of the crime to which she was induced, she should be  prosecuted in the courts of justice; that Leocadia Desamparado, prompted by said inducement,  invited  the justice of the peace Pedro Ferrer to come, as he in fact did come, on the night of the aforesaid day, March 7, 1924,  to her house for the aforesaid purpose and that once there  and seated on a  chair with its back  toward the door of the kitchen where the defendants Segundo Badilla, Restituto  Tupas, Agaton Dy-Cayco, Catalino  Gonzalez alias Mack Gonzalez, Julian Domingo alias Julian  Bongol and Quirino Araez had previously placed themselves, obeying the instructions and orders of the defendant Epifanio Tupas  given under the circumstances aforementioned  for the purpose  of successfully  killing  said justice of the peace  Pedro Ferrer, and taking advantage of the fact that the latter was unaware of the treacherous plot against him and had no  means of defense, the aforesaid defendants Segundo Badilla,  Restituto  Tupas, Agaton  Dy-Cayco, Catalino Gonzalez  alias Mack Gonzalez,  Julian  Domingo alias  Julian Bongol and Quirino Araez and one Jovito Carmales, previously provided with daggers and canes and  other deadly weapons, and cooperating with one another, did willfully, unlawfully and criminally through craft, premeditation and treachery, and with abuse of  superior strength,  and taking the law  in their own hands, assault, beat and attack said  justice  of the peace Pedro  Ferrer,  inflicting the following bruises and injuries,  to wit:  (1)  One penetrating wound, mortal by necessity,  in the epigastric region of the abdomen  If inches wide and 4£  inches deep; (2) one contusion on the back of the left hand;  (3) one contusion on the sides  of both knees;  (4) one contusion in the right iliac region; and (5) several contusions on the superior and inferior parts of both knees; as a  result of which he died a few minutes later. ""Contrary  to article 403 of the Penal  Code  with the concurrence of  the sixth,  eighth,  ninth,  twelfth,  fourteenth,  fifteenth and twentieth circumstances of  article  10 of the same Code."" To this information the  defendants pleaded not guilty, but upon trial the court below found them guilty as charged and sentenced each of them to suffer the penalty  of cadena perpetua, and to jointly  and severally indemnify the heirs of the deceased  in the sum of P1,000, with their proportional shares  of the costs.  From this sentence all of the defendants appealed. It appears from the evidence that at the  time the crime was committed there were two secret  societies or associations in the municipality of Sagay of which one was called Kusug Sang Imol and the  other Mainawaon ; that bitter feeling existed between the two associations which sometimes resulted in personal violence ; that the deceased was a ""protector"" of the Mainawaon and was accused of favoritism by  the Kusug Sang Imol of which society all of the defendants were members;  that late in  the afternoon of March 7, 1924, while on his way to the house of  one  Bernabe Nunez to perform a marriage ceremony, the deceased was approached by Leocadia Desamparado who asked him to come to her house that evening as she had important matters to discuss with him; that the deceased  accepted the  invitation  and told Leocadia that he would  come  to her house after the termination of the marriage ceremony; and  that he went there about 10 o'clock that evening. As to what subsequently occurred, we have the testimony of Jovito Carmales who, on the witness stand, stated among other things that in the evening of March 7, 1924, the defendant Segundo Badilla, vice-president of the Kusug Sang Imol , came to his house and told him that Epifanio Tupas, the local president of the same society, wanted to  see him; that he went with Segundo  Badilla to the house of Epifanio; that on  their arrival there they found all the other accused in this case present,  and a meeting was held presided over by Epifanio Tupas; that upon the meeting being called  to order, Epifanio  announced  that the purpose of the meeting was to inform  the members present that in the town of Sagay there was a tyrant  and oppressor whose death was necessary for the prosperity of the Kusug Sang Imol ; that  as long as this tyrant and oppressor was living, there would be no peace in the town of Sagay; and that this  man was the justice  of the peace, Pedro Ferrer. Carmales further testified that  Segundo Badilla then expressed some misgivings as to what would befall them if they killed the justice of the peace, but Epifanio Tupas answered that they needed have no fear because they would have a lawyer  to defend them and that the Government was  theirs; that Epifanio thereupon  directed the  defendant Quirino Araez to read the form of the secret oath taken by the  members of Kusug Sang Imol upon their joining the society; that after the oath had  been read, Epifanio said  dramatically: ""Here is the dagger, the knife, and the flashlight,"" and thereupon delivered the dagger Exhibit 0, knife Exhibit G, and  flashlight Exhibit L to Segundo Badilla, some of the other defendants being given sticks or clubs  of palma brava; that after the weapons had  been distributed the meeting adjourned and the defendants went to the house of Leocadia Desamparado  and entered the kitchen of the house; that the door opening between the kitchen and the main part of the house was covered by a curtain or petate ; that Segundo Badilla peeped through the curtain and found that the deceased was sitting on a bench inside of the house with his back towards  the kitchen door, and that  Leocadia was sitting on another bench opposite the deceased with a table between them upon which there was a lighted lamp; that thereupon Badilla, followed  by the other defendants, entered the room, Badilla  stealthily approaching the  deceased from behind and seized him by the neck  blowing out the light at the same time; that the other  defendants also laid hold  of the  deceased and overpowered and held him while Badilla,  with the aid of the flashlight, lifted up the undershirt of the deceased and stabbed him with the dagger Exhibit  O in  the  abdomen near the navel; that after having done so, Segundo Badilla handed Leocadia the knife Exhibit G, and told her to cry out; that Leocadia did so, whereupon the defendants made their escape, some of them passing through the main door of  the house and the  others  through  the kitchen;  that after having  left the  house of Leocadia Desamparado, the defendants again went to the house  of  Epifanio Tupas  to give him an account of the result of  their expedition and, upon  arriving there, Segundo Badilla said to  Epifanio Tupas: ""I doubt that he will survive."" It appears  from the testimony of other witnesses  that after the deceased was wounded, he was with some difficulty able to walk to his own house near by, where he expired  in about six minutes after his arrival. Leocadia Desamparado was  also presented  as a witness against the accused, but,  to the apparent surprise of the prosecuting attorney, retracted her confession and testified that while she was sleeping in her house on the evening in question, she was awakened by the deceased who attempted to force her  to have  intercourse with  him and that in the ensuing struggle, she remembered that she had a knife Exhibit G  in her bed and that  seizing the knife she stabbed  the deceased. Though the testimony of Carmales seems  straightforward and convincing and remained unshaken by a very lengthy and ably conducted cross-examination, we are mindful of the fact that it is the testimony of a coconspirator and accomplice  and, as such, must be received with great caution.  As to the defendant Julian  Domingo, it is fully corroborated by the latter's confession with  which it  is substantially in accord.   In the appellants' brief some stress is placed on the fact that  Domingo began his confession with a  denial of all personal knowledge of the commission of the crime and that it was not until he had been examined at some length  that he admitted his participation therein and implicated most of his codefendants.  In our opinion, this fact,  so far from weakening the confession,  rather strengthens it and tends to show that it was not obtained by improper  means; had it been the purpose of the investigating authorities to extort a false confession from Domingo,  the first part of his statement would hardly have been reported in full. At the trial of the case the  confession of Leocadia Desamparado was admitted in evidence to contradict her testimony  and the appellants assign as error that the court below apparently took her  confession and that of  Julian Domingo into consideration upon certain points affecting the  whole case.   The general rule is that extrajudicial declarations of a coconspirator made before the formation of the conspiracy or after the accomplishment of its object, are inadmissible in evidence as against the other coconspirators, on the ground that the accused in a  criminal case has the constitutional right to be confronted with the witnesses against him and to cross-examine them.  It has, however,  been  held that where  extrajudicial  confessions had been made by several persons charged with a conspiracy and  there could have been no  collusion with reference to the several confessions, the fact that the statements are in all material respects identical is confirmatory of the testimony of an accomplice.  It was so held in the important case of United  States vs. .  Lancaster (44 Fed., 896), where three persons were jointly charged with a conspiracy, one  of  whom made a voluntary confession, another was permitted  to become a witness for the Government under implied  pardon and testified, and the third made a declaration during the pendency of the criminal enterprise, the court saying among other things that ""*  *   *  while the testimony of the two accomplices could not corroborate each other, and while the confession of Clemens cannot be considered as evidence against the other prisoners, yet the unanimity of statements of the three, made without the opportunity of conference,  or without  proof that  they did confer, is a fact which tends to corroborate the three statements so made.  *   *   *"" In other words, while an extra judicial declaration of a coconspirator may not  be directly introduced  in  evidence against another coconspirator as proof of specific facts, it may nevertheless  under certain conditions be taken into consideration as a circumstance in judging the credibility of the testimony of an accomplice. In the present case there is no indication that the three declarations were the result of collusion or that the declarants had  the opportunity of  conferring with each  other before making the declarations.  Neither is there any valid reason to believe that the statements made by the declarants were laid  in their  mouths  by other persons.  On the contrary,  the declarations themselves indicate  that they were spontaneous  expressions of  what was in  the minds of the  declarants at the time.  All three declarations were legally before the court and we do not think that  in these circumstances the court erred in giving some consideration to the  fact that they were very similar to each other and substantially in accord. On the other hand, the court undoubtedly erred in using the confession of Leocadia Desamparado as the sole source of the finding  that  she was induced to cooperate in the killing of Pedro Ferrer by the promise of a remuneration of P1,000 and five heads of carabaos; the confession was not admissible  as direct proof of  that fact. But even if the confessions are left wholly out of consideration, there is  in our opinion sufficient corroboration  of Carmales' testimony to sustain the judgment of the court below.  It  is abundantly proven  that there was a very bitter feeling on the part of the  defendants against the deceased and strong motives for the commission of the crime.  It is also sufficiently  established by  additional evidence that several  persons took  part in the  crime; the widow of the deceased, an apparently  reliable witness, testifies that he, on his  arrival at his  house after having been wounded, said ""me han traicionado""  (they  have betrayed me)  and that  he instructed her  to  close the doors and windows because they were going to kill him.  We have also the testimony of the witness Teofilo Alvarado that he heard several persons run away from Leocadia's house immediately after the  wounding of the deceased and the witness Tomas Rodriguez states that he, about 9 o'clock in the evening,  saw Restituto Tupas and Agaton Dy-Cayco with two companions in front of the  house of Leocadia. Another corroborating circumstance is that according  to the testimony of the two physicians who examined the body of the deceased, the  fatal wound was inflicted by a double edged weapon such as the dagger Exhibit O, the width  of the blade of which was found to correspond to the length of the lips  of the wound.  This dagger was found hidden behind a post in the house of Epifanio Tupas.   The palma brava clubs, in regard to which Carmales  testified, were found in the same house hidden behind a trunk and covered with rugs.  The flashlight Exhibit L was  also found  in Epifanio's house. The statement of Carmales that the deceased was sitting at  the table in Leocadia's house when attacked by the defendants is corroborated by the fact that his cigarette holder together with ashes of cigarettes were found on the table and that his slippers were found under the same table together with his folded  raincoat. The theory  of  the  defense that  Ferrer was  killed  by Leocadia Desamparado in defense of her  honor is contradicted by the fact that he came to her house at her invitation as testified to by  Buenaventura Rodriguez.   It is also to be noted that her bed, located in a portion of the house separated from the sala by a curtain, was found undisturbed and that the small knife with which she claimed to have inflicted  the wound is one  edged and was found on  the floor  of  the sala;  and that it was covered with an oily substance and had no  blood on it.  This fact also corroborates the testimony of Carmales that the  knife  was  not used in wounding the  deceased,  but  was handed to Leocadia by Segundo Badilla in the  sala of the  house.   Another circumstance which also corroborates Carmales' testimony is that two benches in the sala were overturned indicating that a struggle had taken place  in that part of the house. It is also suggested by the defense that the crime might have  been  committed  by Jose Lobaton, a policeman with whom Leocadia was living and who was the father of her two children .   It  appears however that Lobaton  was not in the town of Sagay on the evening in question.   Moreover, he was a member of  Mainawaon society  and probably  on friendly terms with the deceased.  If, as we think has been clearly proven, Leocadia  and the  deceased were merely sitting at the table in the sala of the house conversing with each other, Lobaton could hardly have had sufficient motive to resort to physical violence .  The fact that the deceased On his arrival at his house, after being wounded, asked his wife to close the doors and windows and send for the police because ""they"" were going to kill him, is also a strong argument against this theory, and  so is the fact that when the fatal wound was inflicted upon the deceased, the dagger penetrated the lower hem of his undershirt thus showing that the garment was pulled up to his waist at that time, a fact which  corroborates Carmales' testimony and  could not  very well have occurred if there had been only one assailant. The case for the defense has been very ably argued and our attention has been called to several apparent flaws in the evidence for the prosecution,  but  after  a  painstaking examination of  the voluminous  record, we cannot find that the judge of the court below erred in his appreciation of the evidence, and have no reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused.  It may well be that Carmales in describing what occurred in the house of Leocadia drew to some extent on his'imagination in regard to details which  could hardly have been accurately observed in the darkness, and considering that he probably was anxious to exculpate himself as far as possible, we need not necessarily believe that he was the last of the conspirators to enter the room in which the crime was committed; but one cannot read the transcript of  his testimony without becoming impressed with  his apparent  sincerity and without feeling that he in the main told the truth. There  are  certain  things which  have not  been  satisfactorily explained and  in regard  to  which  the record leaves us more or less in the dark, but which are not of decisive importance.   There is, for instance, no explanation of the fact that while there was blood on the undershirt and  drawers  of the deceased, there were no  signs  of it on the trousers  alleged to have been worn by him on the occasion in question  and it is quite possible that he did not wear them at the time the dagger wound was inflicted. There is also room for the suspicion that he did not visit Leocadia with  the purest of motives at such a late hour and that he in view of her invitation entertained expectations which do not  appear  to have  been fulfilled.  In these circumstances he may have felt  reluctant to inform his wife as to his whereabouts and this may be the reason why he did not give her any details when she asked him how he was wounded, but limited himself to saying ""me han traicionado;  me han traicionado.""  It is,  of  course,  also possible that he  at  that  time was too feeble to think coherently and to describe what had taken place. Counsel for the defense strenuously argue that the statement of Carmales as to the manner in which the crime was committed is so improbable as to  be  unworthy of belief. We do not think so; the facts narrated are unusual, but considering the situation as a whole, the story told by the witnesses for the prosecution is not improbable, though it may suffer from minor inaccuracies. It is insisted that had it been the intention to kill Ferrer, all of his assailants would have been armed.  But when it is considered that the plan evidently  was to have it appear that the killing- was done by Leocadia in self defense, the reason for arming only one of the defendants with  a cutting instrument becomes quite apparent; had more than one of them  been so armed, it would perhaps have  been difficult to control them and  several wounds might  have been inflicted which would have rendered Leocadia's story less credible.   There would also, in the deep darkness,  have been the danger of the conspirators wounding each other. Badilla seems to have taken special care to place the wound in a vital spot and the persons who planned the crime undoubtedly knew that a single deep dagger wound in that spot would mean certain death and would serve  their purpose. Counsel also scout the idea that the small knife Exhibit G was handed to Leocadia by Badilla after he had wounded the deceased with the dagger Exhibit O, but we see nothing unreasonable  or improbable therein.  Exhibit G is a small knife which might be used for peeling or cutting vegetables and which a  woman would be likely to have within reach and use, whereas her possession of a dagger  such as the Exhibit 0, might be  more  difficult to  explain.  Badilla could, of course, have used  the small  knife  in stabbing the  deceased, but  naturally  preferred to use  the larger weapon as the more  effective and sure. The various assignments of error on legal points are in our  opinion of little  merit.  The court below unquestionably erred in  allowing the fiscal, over the objection of the defense, to have the  alleged oath of the Kusug Sang Imol read to the witness Carmales and then to ask the witness if that was the oath he had  taken. The question was leading and should not have been allowed, but  as there is other evidence as to the main features  of the oath,  the error is of comparatively  little importance  and  is  non- prejudicial. Neither is the failure of the court to make specific  findings of fact in  regard to the defenses of alibi reversible error.   Such defenses are frequently relied on  in criminal cases, but oral evidence  tending to prove alibi is so easily manufactured and usually so unreliable that it can rarely be given credence.  The evidence with which alibi is sought to be established in this case is of the usual order and we do not think the trial judge greatly erred in failing to discuss it  at length. We find nothing illegal in the examination  of  the defendants and  other witnesses by the fiscal previously to the filing of the complaint.   This proceeding is authorized by section 1687 of the Administrative Code  and while it in a sense may be inquisitorial, it is often the only means of discovering the persons who may be reasonably charged with a crime so as to enable the fiscal to prepare his complaint  or information.   In  one form or another, similar investigations are permitted under all systems of criminal procedure. In answer to  the contention that the court erred in refusing,  upon the simple verbal request of counsel for the defense, to  compel the production of the affidavit or confession  of Jovito Carmales  made during  the  investigation held by the fiscal  preliminary to the  filing of the  complaint, we can do no better than to quote the language of the court upon  a  similar  question in the  case of United States vs. . Baluyot  (40 Phil., 385): ""The fourth specification is  addressed to the supposed error of the court in refusing to compel the provincial  fiscal to produce in court at the request of the attorney for the accused certain  written statements which  had been made by the witnesses Pedro Gonzales,  Gregorio de Guzman, and Antonio Aranjuez in  a preliminary  inquiry conducted by the fiscal preparatory to this prosecution.  It appears that after the witnesses  above mentioned had been examined in court for the prosecution,  they  were turned over to the attorney  for the  accused and were by him fully cross-examined.  Later, when the giving of testimony  for the prosecution had been concluded,  the defense proceeded to introduce sundry  witnesses  who were  examined  in  due course.   After  four had  thus  testified, and immediately before the accused  was placed  upon the stand  in  his own behalf, his attorney made the request that the declarations or statements above referred to should be  produced.  The, attorney for the prosecution objected on the ground that one party cannot be compelled to  produce evidence  in favor of the other.  The court was of the opinion that the written declarations the production of which was sought  were of a privileged nature and accordingly overruled the motion* We are of the opinion that the court was  not  in  error in refusing to compel the production of  the documents in question.  They were not  original or independent evidence of such a character as to give the accused an unqualified right to compel  their  production, and no proper basis was laid in the cross-examination of the witnesses who had made those statements to justify their production with a view to the impeachment of the declarants.   The  request was of course based upon  the supposition or expectation  that if the statements of the witnesses before the  fiscal were produced, they might be found to contain something different from what was contained in their testimony given in court. ""We know  of  no rule  of practice which  sustains the contention of  the appellant. The statements in question were not  the sworn declarations of  witnesses taken in conformity with the requirements of section 13 of General Orders, No.  58, and which are commonly attached to the 'expediente'  transmitted by the  committing magistrate to the Court of First Instance.  In the case at bar the preliminary examination before  the  committing magistrate  was waived by the accused, and the declarations of the  witnesses for the prosecution were therefore not taken before the magistrate.  The declarations referred  to were, on the contrary, taken in an investigation conducted by the fiscal under the  authority of section 1687 of the Administrative Code.  This section authorizes the fiscal,  if he deems it wise, to conduct an investigation into the matter of  any crime  or misdemeanor for  the  purpose of instituting or carrying on a  criminal prosecution.   It is expressly declared that this section shall not be construed to authorize a  provincial  fiscal to act as a justice of the peace in  any preliminary  investigation.   The  proceeding here contemplated is of an administrative character, and the information thereby acquired is intended for the use of the fiscal in the conduct of the prosecution. Such declarations therefore pertain to the official file in the office of the public prosecutor and are  not subject to production at the mere request of the attorney for the  accused where no ground therefor had been laid. ""In order  that we may  not be misunderstood,  as well as for the  purpose of clarifying  the practice in such matters, a few words may here be properly said in  respect to the proper mode of proceeding in a case where a party wishes to  get  before the  court  contradictory statements made by a witness who is testifying for the adversary party.  For instance, if the attorney  for the accused had information that a certain witness,  say Pedro Gonzales, had made and signed a sworn statement before the fiscal materially different from that given  in  his testimony before the court, it was incumbent upon the attorney when cross-examining said witness to direct his attention to the discrepancy and  to ask  him if he  did not make  such and such statement before the fiscal or if he did not there make a statement different from that delivered in court.  If the Witness admits the making of such contradictory statements, the accused  has the benefit of the admission, while the witness has the opportunity to explain the discrepancy, if he can.  On the  other hand, if the witness denies making any such contradictory statement, the accused has the right to prove that the witness did make such statement; and if  the fiscal should refuse upon due notice to produce the document, secondary  evidence of  the contents thereof would  be admissible.  This process of  cross-examining a witness upon the point of prior contradictory statements is called in the practice of the American courts 'laying a predicate'  for the: introduction  of  contradictory statements. It is almost  universally  accepted that unless a ground is thus laid upon cross-examination, evidence of contradictory statements are not admissible to impeach a witness; though undoubtedly the matter is to a large  extent in the discretion of the court. ""We wish to add that in a case of this kind, if the  accused had, by affidavit or otherwise, made it appear to the satisfaction of the court that the witnesses named had made statements in their declarations before the fiscal materially at variance  with their statements in court and that the production of said declarations was  necessary or even desirable, in the interests of justice, the court would have had ample power to order their production.   No such showing, or intimation, was made, in this case; and the attorney who made the motion was merely angling at random to discover something that  might prove to be  favorable to his client.  To put  a court in error for  refusing to entertain such a motion would encourage frivolous delays and tend to embarrass the speedy and proper administration of Justice."" Counsel also assigns as error that the court below sanctioned the failure of the fiscal to include Jovito Carmales and Leocadia Desamparado in the information  and afterwards permitted their presentation as witnesses for the prosecution without following the procedure prescribed by section 2 of Act No.  2709 which reads as  follows: ""When two or more persons are charged with the commission of a certain crime, the competent court, at any time before they have entered upon their defense, may direct any of them to be discharged, that he may be a witness for the Government when in the judgment of the court: ""( a )  There is absolute necessity for the testimony of the accused whose discharge is requested; ""( b )  There is no other direct evidence available for the proper  prosecution of the  crime committed, except the testimony of said accused; ""( c ) The testimony of said accused can be substantially corroborated in  its material points; ""( d )  Said accused does not appear to be the most guilty, and ""( e ) Said accused has not at any time been convicted of the crime of perjury or false testimony or of any other crime involving  moral turpitude."" In this case the discharge of Carmales from the original complaint was ordered by the justice of the peace upon motion of the fiscal during the preliminary investigation. Whether the justice of the peace exceeded  his jurisdiction in doing so at that stage of the proceedings, need not here be determined.  If he lacked such jurisdiction,  it would merely have the effect of laying Carmales open to another prosecution  for the same offense, but would not  affect his competency  as a witness for the prosecution at the trial of the case.  An examination  of the section  quoted shows clearly  that its only object is to prevent unnecessary or arbitrary exclusions from the complaint of persons guilty of the crime charged, and that it has nothing to do with the admissibility of their  testimony or their competency as witnesses.  Consequently, the court below did not err in permitting Carmales to testify  (U.  S. vs. . Abanzado, 37 Phil., 658; U. S. vs. . Enriquez, 40 Phil., 603; U.  S. vs. . De Guzman, 30 Phil,, 416; U. S. vs. . Alabot, 38 Phil., 698; and People vs. . Velazco, 42 Phil., 75). Considering the evidence and giving due weight to the findings of the trial judge who  had the opportunity to observe the witnesses and form an estimate of their credibility, we are of the opinion that the judgment appealed from  must be affirmed.  The imposition of the death penalty might, perhaps, be justified, but  in committing the crime, the defendants were laboring under strong provocation, and the court is not unanimous as  to the propriety of that penalty in this case. The judgment appealed from is therefore affirmed, each of the  appellants to  pay  one-seventh  of the costs. So ordered. Avancena, C. J.,  Street,  Malcolm, Villamor, Romualdez, Johns, and Villa-Real, JJ., concur. DISSENTING JOHNSON, J., I cannot bring myself to agree to a sentence sending men and women to prison during their natural lives  upon the sole testimony of self-convicted criminal.  I am now referring to the facts contained in the record and not merely to the facts stated in the majority opinion.  Eliminating the extrajudicial confessions of the witnesses used by the Government, there is no sufficient evidence in the record to show  that the defendants are guilty of the crime charged. In all justice they should be acquitted, the complaint against them  should be  dismissed,  and they should be discharged from the custody of the law. Judgment affirmed.
