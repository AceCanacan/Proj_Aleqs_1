D E C I S I O N AQUINO, J.: Antonio Savellano  appealed from the decision of the Court of First Instance of South Cotabato convicting him of rape, sentencing him to reclusion perpetua and ordering him to indemnify Zosima Jenilla in the sum of ten thousand pesos (Criminal Case No. 2073). The evidence for the prosecution shows that on July 18, 1969 Zosima Jenilla, a seventeen-year old unmarried girl, whom Judge Pedro Samson S. Animas described \"as barely four feet tall and very cute\", was residing at Seven-Hills, Maasim, Kiamba, South Cotabato with her parents.  During her childhood Zosima was sickly.  She was given injections and medicines.  For that reason, \"she has a poor hearing\" and was somewhat \"abnormal\" (Exh. B).  Her attainment was Grade two in the primary school. At about ten o'clock in the morning of that day, her mother sent her on an errand to the house of her elder sister, Natividad Jenilla-Josoy, in Highland Breeze, also in Seven-Hills, about a kilometer from Zosima's house. On her way to her destination, she passed the cornfield which was fifty meters, away from the house of Antonio Savellano, the twenty-year old unmarried farmer already named, who is much taller than her and whom she had known since childhood.  He was stealthily following her. Suddenly, he seized her from behind by holding her shoulders and neck.  He dragged her away from the trail along a distance of fifty meters to a place near a coconut palm in the cornfield near his house and forced her to lie down.  She tried to shout but Savellano covered her mouth with his left hand.  She resisted the assault by kicking, slapping and boxing Savellano and scratching him on the face (Exh. A) but she succumbed to the superior force employed by her assailant.  He succeeded in pinning her down to the ground.  The stump of his right arm pressed her chest. Weakened considerably by her struggle and resistance and the persistent force employed by Savellano, he succeeded in placing himself on top of her.  He unzippered his pants with his left hand, exposed his penis, removed her panty and half-slip and had sexual intercourse with her.  (Zosima narrated the incident while standing and crying in court, 35 tsn.  Her dress, panty and half-slip were presented in evidence as Exhs. E, F and G). After the sexual act, Savellano warned Zosima not to tell anybody what he had done to her.  He said that he would kill her if she squealed.  She stood up and picked up her panty and half-slip.  She hurled stones at him.  Then, she proceeded to her sister's house and tearfully reported the outrage which she had suffered. She told her brother-in-law, Marcelo Josoy, that she was going to stab Savellano.  Her dress was covered with mud.  Josoy told her not to stab Savellano but to see her cousin, Alejandro Sasam.  The latter advised her to inform her mother of the accident.  Mother and daughter reported the incident to the barrio captain.  They took that step so that the male persons in their family would not take the law into their hands.  Patrolman Rufo Pajares arrested Savellano in the afternoon of July 18th. Savellano's house was about a kilometer away from Zosima's house.  His mother is a comadre of Zosima's mother, she being the godmother of Savellano's sister.  Savellano never courted Zosima. The only time that he went to her house was about five months before the incident, when he bought sacks. That was the occasion when he had to sell something in Dadiangas. Catalina Tale, who is a first cousin of Savellano and Zosima, who had known him since he was small and with whom she lived for two months, characterized him as \"very foolish to women \".  He allegedly committed \"foolishness\" against some girls.  On one occasion in December, 1967, he entered Catalina's bedroom and tried to rape her while she was asleep. He was not able to consummate the rape because she was awakened by his attempt on her honor.  She kicked him (Exh. C).  She said that Savellano could weed grasses and haul corn. The municipal health officer examined Zosima on Sunday afternoon, July 20th, or about fifty-two hours after the incident.  His findings were as follows: \"The labia majora and minora do not show any distinct sign of recent injury.  Only the remains of the hymen ( caruncula hymenales ) may be perceived. The vagina admits two fingers without pain. No specimen of semen could be obtained. Remarks:  There has been insertions (sic) of hard object into the vagina\" (Exh. D). The doctor explained that his finding that \"the labia majora and minora do not show any distinct sign of recent injury\" means that Zosima \"has not given birth\". He said that \" caruncula hymenales \" means that the hymen had been ruptured.  The fact that two fingers could be inserted into the vagina without pain means that the girl was no longer a virgin.  The expression ''insertions of hard object into the vagina\" means that the vagina had been expanded by a hard object like the penis. Four days after the incident or on July 22nd the sanitary inspector examined Savellano.  He found that Savellano had three or four scratches on the left cheek and neck which required three to five days to heal (Exh. A). The case was investigated by Patrolman G. L. Bautista in the office of the chief of police.  Zosima, Mrs. Jenilla and Catalina Tale executed before the municipal judge sworn statements about the rape.  They delivered to Patrolman Bautista a checkered dress colored yellow, blue and white, a white half-slip and a white pantie (page 5 of the record).  On July 23rd, a complaint for rape, thumbmarked by Zosima. was filed in the municipal court.  Savellano waived the second stage of the preliminary investigation. The Assistant Provincial Fiscal filed the information for rape on August 8, 1969.  The case was tried on October 2, 1969.  The judgment of conviction was promulgated on October 6, 1969. Appellant Savellano raised a jurisdictional question which should first be resolved.  He contends in his fifth assignment of error that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case because the evidence does not show that the offended girl filed a complaint for rape.  He argues that the information filed by the fiscal is nut sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the trial court. His contention has no merit. Zosima Jenilla's verified complaint for rape was filed in the municipal court of Kiamba on July 23, 1969.  It was docketed as Criminal Case No. 999.  It is page 4 of the record elevated by the municipal judge to the Court of First Instance.  It should have been marked as an exhibit by the prosecution.  However, the fiscal's failure to do so did not mean that the trial court did not acquire jurisdiction over the case.  The complaint is a matter of judicial notice (People vs. Bringas, 70 Phil. 528, 530). Appellant Savellano was cognizant of that complaint.  In his written waiver of the second stage of the preliminary investigation, he requested the municipal court to remand the case (meaning the complaint and its supporting affidavits) to the Court of First Instance. Appellant's other four assignment of error are bottomed on the issue of credibility.  His version is that since December, 1968 he and the complainant were sweethearts who had indulged in sexual intercourse ten times. He said that there was no rape because the sexual intercourse was voluntary.  He had known Zosima since they were children .  He used to visit her in her sister's house four times a week when only Zosima was in the house.  If Mrs. Josoy would see him there, she would be angry.  After they became sweethearts, he had sexual intercourse with her three times on the ground floor of Mrs. Josoy's house where Zosima resided.  The sexual intercourse took place when the members of her family were not in the house.  The other acts of sexual intercourse took place in the cornfield.  He allegedly had sexual intercourse with her three times in December, 1968 two times in January and five times in April, 1969.  However, on interrogation by the court, he said that he had no sexual intercourse with Zosima from January to July 18, 1969. Savellano's contradictory testimony on the sexual intercourse with Zosima is quoted below: \"Q.  Do you remember the dates when you have all those five sexual intercourse with Zosima?  — A.  I only remember that day of July 18 but the other occasions I cannot remember anymore. Q.   Was that January, 1969?  The four times of sexual intercourse?  — A.  We did three times in December, two times in January and five times in April (81 tsn). Q.   (by Court):  Do you want to tell us that from January until July 18, 1969, you have no sexual intercourse with her?  — A.  None. Q.   You always meet together between January and, July 18, 1969?  — A.  Yes, because we used to meet in a different house. Q.   But that notwithstanding you did not have sexual intercourse with her?  — A.  We did not (82 tsn). According to Savellano, on July 18, 1969 he and Zosima met at about eleven o'clock in the morning, by prearrangement, in the cornfield owned by her cousin, Catalina Savellano.  They went to a place about fifty or sixty meters from the trail and from his own house, near some coconut trees.  First, he kissed and fondled her nipples for ten minutes, Zosima kissed him.  Then they had carnal intercourse using dried coconut leaves as bedding.  The leaves had been there for sometime, having been used by hem on prior occasions.  He had sexual intercourse with Zosima in that place five times. On July 18th Zosima was wearing a green panty which she herself removed.  He did not notice if she was wearing a half-slip.  The dress presented in court was the one which she wore on the day of the incident. They necked for half an hour. Savellano declared that he loved Zosima and was willing to marry her.  However, her parents did not like him because his right arm had been amputated.  They assumed that he could not support her.  He had sexual intercourse with her \"so that I will be sure they marry us\".  He said that ten days before the incident his mother asked Zosima's parents for her hand in marriage.  His mother told them that he and Zosima were engaged.  Zosima's mother did not agree to the marriage because of his physical defect.  His right hand was amputated due to an accident in the ricemill. After he and Zosima had sexual intercourse on July 18, 1969, he told Zosima that their engagement was futile because they could not get married.  She allegedly cried.  He tried to pacify her.  They talked for about an hour or up to past noontime.  He admitted that when the policeman arrested him in the afternoon, he did not tell the peace officer that he and Zosima were sweethearts. He was boxed by Policeman Bautista while he was confined in the jail at Kiamba.  It was not true that he was examined by a sanitary inspector.  He did not suffer any injuries.  Zosima did not scratch him. Appellant's mother, Silvina Villamira, testified that on July 10, 1969 she asked Zosima's parents for her hand in marriage.  Her son, Antonio, told her that he was in love with Zosima.  Her parents told Savellano's mother that they would think over that proposal.  They did not say when Silvina would know their answer.  She did not inquire from Zosima's parents about their reaction to the marriage proposal.  She did not send food and viands to Zosima's house.  They did not like Savellano because his right hand had been amputated. After Savellano's arrest, Silvina met the members of Zosima's family in Kiamba.  They uttered reproaches against Silvina. In his appeal, Savellano insists that his version, that he had voluntary sexual intercourse with the complainant on July 18, 1969, should be given credence.  He claims that he did not employ force.  He capitalizes on the fact that he is a manco, his right hand having been amputated \"six inches from the wrist\".  He points to certain alleged improbabilities in Zosima's testimony. On the other hand, the trial court found that it was Savellano's story which is not believable and which is contrary to human experience\". [*] After a conscientious perusal of the record, we find that the trial court's conclusion as to appellant's guilt should be upheld. It is true that Savellano has only the full use of his left hand.  He has a physical handicap because he has no right hand.  But the petite complainant, a teenager, is only four feet tall and used to be sickly (Exh. B), whereas, Savellano is five feet and five inches tall (79 tsn) and, as a young farmer, accustomed to manual labor, was quite strong.  It is credible that, with his physical superiority, he was able to overcome the resistance of the complainant and to have forcible carnal knowledge of her. It is not necessary that the force employed against the complaining woman in rape be so great or of such a character as could not be resisted.  It is sufficient that the force used is sufficient to consummate the culprit's purpose of copulating with the offended woman (U.S. vs. Villarosa, 4 Phil. 434, 437 cited in 52 C.J. 1018, note 7; Decision of Supreme Court of Spain, dated May 14, 1878, 3 Viada, Codigo Penal 452; II Hidalgo Codigo Penal 302). The force or violence necessary in rape is naturally a relative term, depending on the age, size and strength of the parties and their relation to each other (75 C.J.S. 475). The conduct of Zosima Jenilla in reporting immediately to the barrio captain that she had been ravished negates appellant's claim that she had voluntary sexual intercourse with him.  As noted by the trial court, it is hard to believe that a seventeen-year old unmarried girl like her would publicly disclose that she had been raped and thus sully her honor and reputation in the community, would allow an examination of her private parts, and would undergo the trouble and humiliation of a 'trial if her motive was not to bring to justice the person who had grievously wronged her (People vs. Canastre, 82 Phil. 480, 483). The penalty of reclusion perpetua imposed by the trial court is in accordance with article 335 of the Revised Penal Code as amended. Wherefore, the lower court's judgment is affirmed with costs against the appellant. SO ORDERED. Zaldivar, (Chairman), Fernando, Barredo, and Fernandez, JJ., concur. Antonio, J., took no part. [*] The trial court said: \"Firstly, if it were true that they were sweethearts and loved one another as seriously claimed by the indictee that the offended party went to the extent of crying after he told her their love was useless as he could not marry her considering the adamant refusal of her parents, it will be inconceivable that such a woman so madly in love with him could afford to report immediately to her sister and mother and consequently to the authorities the fact that she was the victim of such \"a detestable crime of rape, in which a man shows his most heinous side\", by the accused, her lover.  The ordinary course of things would have been for her to remain silent as she used to be, having in mind the 5 previous intercourses they have had or, the other ordinary alternative would have been for them to elope.  That did not happen to her simply because actually they were never sweethearts and the fact of being so was more of a rehearsed tale than the truth. Second, if it were true that they had carnal knowledge for 3 times in December, 1968 and 2 times in January, 1969, no plausible reason was adduced why between January and July 18, 1969 or a period of more than 5 months, the sexual enjoyment which they were used to for 5 times in a period of 2 months did not happen again in the succeeding 5 months when there as nothing shown of the impossibility thereof.  That is quite very unusual. Third, if it were true that they were sweethearts, no valid reason was adduced why Zosima whom he claims madly in love with him, never even cared to whisper to him while incarcerated in jail on July 18, 1969 until date, some words of sympathy and pity, if not of love.  Must she be only a dreamed Juliet? Fourth, the dress, half-slip and the panty was exhibited before the Court were all soiled (Exhibits \"E\", \"F\" and \"G\").  If this carnal knowledge were by mutual agreement, ordinarily this loving Romeo would have told Zosima and the latter would have readily acceded to taking all of her clothings, not only to prevent their being soiled, but also to avoid discovery later by her sister and brother-in-law, and perhaps, by others.  That should have been the ordinary behavior between lovers earnestly taking care of one another.  It did not happen to her and the only conceivable explanation is that, actually, there was more of a case or rape than a sweet romance between 2 hearts in a lovers' lane. Fifth, it is a common tradition among Filipinos especially in the rural areas that whenever the parents of a man seeks the hands of a daughter of another parents for the first time, this visit should be preceded by a letter done previously informing the parents of the girl of this noble intention.  Then, at the appointed time, the parents with one respected leader of the community proceed to the house of the woman sought to be betrothed.  In this, some little food and, perhaps, drinks are offered.  After their meeting, the parents of the girl make known to the parents of the man the time that they should return when a decision will be known.  Alt these things this Court takes judicial notice as part of the customs and tradition of Filipinos especially in our rural areas.  These did not happen here for the simple reason that no such proposal of their marriage was made. Sixth, it is hard to believe that Zosima Jenilla, a cute and young lady of 17 years old would have exposed herself purposely by telling the authorities of the breaking of her chastity exposing the everything that is so divine and sacred to her and subject herself to physical examination by a government physician and then in court trial, faced the whole world, although between sobs and tears, trembling and stated than her virginity was gone on account of the ravish acts of the accused.  The unreasonableness of such a situation becomes real when we consider that the object of such a plea for justice claimed to be her sweetheart against whom no cause for her to persecute was shown (pp. 8-11, Record).

      "- 155 Phil. 421 FIRST DIVISION [ G.R. NO. L-30619. March 29, 1974 ] THE PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF AND APPELLEE, VS. BEN DAYAG, DEFENDANT AND APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N ESGUERRA, J.: Appeal from the judgment of the Court of First Instance of Nueva Ecija, Branch IV, Guimba, finding the accused, Ben Dayag, guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape defined and penalized under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, and sentencing him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua (life imprisonment); to suffer the accessories provided for by law and to pay the costs. As charged in the information, the crime was allegedly committed as follows: \"That on or about the 5th day of February, 1968, in the municipality of Talugtog, Province of Nueva Ecija, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there willfully, unlawfully and feloniously lie with and have sexual intercourse with Lourdes Cinense, against the latter's will and consent. \"Contrary to law.\" The accused having pleaded not guilty to the charge, the prosecution sought to establish its case through the uncorroborated testimony of the alleged rape victim, Lourdes Cinense.  From the decision of the court a quo based on said uncorroborated testimony, We find the following: [1] \"The complaining witness Lourdes Cinense declared that on February 5, 1968, at about 4:30 on the afternoon, she went to her hut at Barrio Sta. Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, to feed her pigs and chickens.  This hut was about two kilometers away from their house in Barrio Cinense, Talugtog.  At that time, her husband Juan Pedro was then in the farm at Barrio Cinense, attending to the second crop.  While she was feeding her pigs under her house at Sta. Catalina, the accused Ben Dayag entered the door of the house, embraced her, kissed her and laid her down. She struggled but Ben Dayag forced her down and in the course of her struggle, her dress was torn.  The accused, also through force, removed her pantie and forced her down and when she was lying down, this lay on top of her, kissed her, embraced her and did not loosen his hold on her.  He then inserted his private organ in her sexual organ and commenced the act of sexual intercourse, all the time she was struggling to get loose from his hold but the accused held her tightly and threatened her with his long gun that if she would move, he would shoot her.  This threat infused fear on her and as a result, the accused was able to commit the sexual intercourse which lasted for about ten minutes.  After this sexual act, Ben Dayag released his hold on her, embraced her again and afterwards, left her after wearing his pants.  Lourdes Cinense after the sexual intercourse, sat down and felt tired for what had been done to her.  Afterwards, she went home and upon arrival, she cooked their food.  Her husband Juan Pedro arrived home between 7:00 and 8:00 o'clock in the evening and saw Lourdes Cinense trembling.  He then inquired why she was in that condition and Lourdes Cinense complained to him that she had been raped by Ben Dayag.  Juan Pedro at once went out to call their children who were in the house of his mother. Afterwards, he returned to their house and there saw his wife lying prostrate with her mouth foaming and he learned that she had taken poison. He shouted for help from the neighbors who came immediately and his brother also came to their succor.  His brother and cousin took Lourdes Cinense to Guimba for medical treatment.  Juan Pedro stayed in the house worrying of what had happened to his wife.  He went out of his house in search of Ben Dayag to kill him but fortunately he did not find the accused.  He returned to his house and on second thought he reflected that if he would kill Ben Dayag he would answer therefor so he finally decided to take the matter to the courts of justice.  Lourdes Cinense was taken to the clinic of Dr. Duval at Guimba, Nueva Ecija, in a jeep owned by Barrio Captain Benjamin Patacsil.  She was treated in the clinic for four days, beginning the night of February 5, 1968.  After her release from the clinic, Lourdes Cinense filed the complaint against Ben Dayag, Exhibit \"A\".  Thereafter Ben Dayag could not be seen anymore in the neighborhood.\" On the other hand the accused denied the commission of the crime and interposed the following alibi, as stated in the decision: \"Ben Dayag, whose true name is Bienvenido Dayag, testifying for himself, declared that on February 5, 1968, he was in his house at Barrio Cinense, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija; that at about 8:00 o'clock in the morning of said date, he went to the barrio hall of Barrio Cinense to do some work there; that he had many companions in undertaking the work and some of his companions were Honorato Lomboy, David Gamit, Ventura Abad, Juan Pedro, Ireneo Santiago and others; that his wife Normacion Pascual was also in the barrio hall, working with Valeriana Santiago, Maria Manangan, Lourdes Cinense and others; that the men finished their work later while the women left their work very much earlier; that on the afternoon of said date, the men worked from 2:00 to 5:00 o'clock; that when he went home his companions were Lourdes Cinense, Valeriana Santiago, Maria Manangan and his wife; that Juan Pedro was also going home following them; that when he reached his house he let his carabao drink; that after his carabao had drunk, he went inside his house and did not leave it and slept at about 8:00 o'clock.\" (Italics ours) This testimony of accused Dayag was corroborated by his wife, Normacion Pascual, but the trial court rejected their testimonies as unworthy of credence, accepted as true the uncorroborated testimony of complainant Lourdes Cinense and found defendant Ben Dayag guilty of rape as charged.  Hence this appeal. Appellant, through counsel de oficio, makes the following assignment of errors: 1. \"That the court erred in alleging (sic holding) that the defense of alibi of the defendant-appellant is not worthy of credit because no impartial and unbiased evidence coming from disinterested residents of barrio Cinense, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, was presented to corroborate it; 2. \"That the trial court erred in alleging (sic holding) that evidence of maltreatment in the person of the complaining witness Lourdes Cinense, is not borne by competent evidence, it having been the result of mere insinuation; 3. \"That the trial court erred in alleging (sic ruling) that it cannot accept the testimony of Dra. Duval as to the true date of the admission of Lourdes Cinense in her clinic to be February 7, 1968; 4. \"That the trial court erred in finding the defendant-appellant, Ben Dayag, guilty of the crime of rape, and not giving credence to the defense of said defendant-appellant.\" The sole issue in this case is whether or not the wholly uncorroborated story of the complainant as to the commission of the alleged rape is impeccably true and is sufficient basis for the conviction of the accused.  The corollary issue is whether the trial court, in finding the accused guilty and meting out the heavy penalty for the heinous crime of rape, did so after reaching that requisite degree of moral certainty as to the guilt of appellant Ben Dayag. I A careful review of the record and of the testimony of the offended party, a woman of 38 years, married for more than five years, with five children and in good health, discloses telltales of falsehood, contradictions and conflicts on vital details which make our conscience recoil in accepting the veracity of her story.  In her sworn statement, dated February 12, 1968, given to support the complaint, she stated: \"That on Monday, February 5, 1968, at about 4:30 in the afternoon, I went to our hut in barrio Sta. Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija, to feed my pigs and chickens; \"That when I was getting the can of rice bran inside the hut, one Ben Dayag, entered the hut without my consent, so that I asked him \"WHY\"?  and he said and pointed to me his firearm.\" IF YOU WILL SHOUT, I AM GOING TO SHOOT YOU\", and dragged me inside the hut, and once inside the hut, he (Ben Dayag) began kissing me, embraced me, laid me down the floor and laid on top of me; \"That upon receiving such abusive acts, I struggled and tried to get loose of his hands, until I became unconscious so that he was able to have sexual intercourse on me; \"That upon regaining consciousness, I tried to stand up but again Ben Dayag, embraced me and laid me down to the floor and stepped on my legs to prevent me to stand up and pointed again his firearm to me and said \"IF YOU ARE GOING TO TELL YOUR HUSBAND OR THE POLICE AUTHORITIES ABOUT THIS MATTER, I AM GOING TO KILL YOU AS SOON AS I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO,\" then he left.\" On February 16, 1968, in the preliminary examination before the Municipal Judge of Talugtog, the same Lourdes Cinense stated under oath that the accused said nothing to threaten her.  She said as follows: [2] xxx                      xxx                      xxx \"Q Where did Ben Dayag enter that time, the door or the window? A At the door, sir. Q While Ben Dayag was inside the hut that afternoon, did you have any conversation if any? A No, sir. Q Did he talk with you? A No, sir. Q Did you talk with him? A I asked him why he entered inside the hut. Q And what did he tell you if any? A He said nothing but embraced me, sir. Q What did you do when he embraced you? A I tried to get off, but I was not able to do so. Q When you were not able to get loose from his hold, what did he do to you if any? A He embraced and kissed me and did what he like because I was then unconscious. Q Can you remember the precise time when you fell unconscious? A No sir. Q For how long did you remain in the state of unconsciousness? A More or less 45 minutes, sir. Q When you regained consciousness, Ben Dayag was already gone? A He was still there, sir. Q He was still embracing you when you revived your senses? A Yes sir, that was the time when I saw the gun. Q Was he naked at the time you regained consciousness? A Yes, sir. Q Do you mean to say his pants and inner trousers were totally taken off? A Yes, sir. Q How about you, were you totally undressed when you regained consciousness? A My pantie was taken off. Q Where was your pantie then placed at the time? A It was placed by my side. Q Did you place it by your side? A No, sir. Q Did sexual intercourse take place between you and Ben Dayag that afternoon? A Yes sir, perhaps he consummated this act because I was then in state of unconsciousness. Q You were still laying frustrate (prostrate) with Ben Dayag on top of you naked when you first noticed him upon regaining consciousness, is that correct? A Yes, sir. Q You have already revived your senses when you noticed him on top of you, is that correct? A No, sir. Q In other words, when Ben Dayag was on your top, you did not notice nor feel what was going or being done to you? A No, sir. Q You did not feel the insertion of his private part because you were then unconscious at that time? A No, sir. Q You did not feel any pain in your vagina? A I did not feel anything because I was unconscious. Q Was he able to penetrate your genital organ and secreted his spermatozoa to yours? A I do not know, sir because I was too unconscious.\" * * *                                        * * *                                        * * * Thus complainant claims that the accused employed force and threats which made her unconscious for sometime, and that she did not even feel anything when ravished, by accused.  However, her own testimony during the trial [3] militates against her thesis.  She said: \"Q To where did Ben Dayag enter? A At our door, sir. Q Door of your house or what? A The door of our house, sir. Q Why? Where were you feeding your pigs then? A Under the house, sir. Q What happened when Ben Dayag entered? A He embraced me sir. Q What else did he do after he embraced you? A He kissed and laid me down. Q What did you do when he kissed and embraced you and laid you down? A I struggled, sir. Q When you struggled, what happened to you? A He did what he wanted to me, sir. Q Will you please tell us in detail what he did to you? A He did what he wanted to me, sir. Q You stated he laid you down on the floor, to what floor are you referring to? A On the floor of the living room of our house, sir. Q Will you please tell us what happened, how did it come that you were laid down in the sala when you were feeding your pigs according to you, downstairs of your house? A When he entered our house, he laid me down. Q Where were you at that time Ben Dayag kissed and embraced you and laid you down on the floor? A I was inside our house, sir. Q When Ben Dayag was able to lay you down, what happened? A He did what he wanted, sir. Q Were you wearing any clothes at the time Ben Dayag forcibly laid you down? A I had, sir. Q What happened to that clothes of yours or dress of yours at the time you were laid down by Dayag? A It was torn, sir. Q Why was it torn? A How could it not be torn when I struggled with him? Q Were you wearing a panty or not? A I had, sir. Q What happened to that panty of yours? A It was torn sir. How could it not be torn when he was forcing what he wanted to do. Q What did he do with that panty of yours, if any? A He removed it, sir. Q After Ben Dayag was able to remove your panty what did he do to your person? A He did what he wanted, sir. Q Yes. What did he do? The Court can not understand. A He laid on me sir. Q On top of you? A Yes, sir. Q When he was already on top of you, what did he do to you? A He did what he wanted, sir. Q What is that thing he did to you because we can not understand that? A He laid on top of me, sir. Q Afterwards? A He kissed me sir. Q After he kissed you what else transpired? A He just kissed me, sir. He did not loose his hold on me. Q Yes, when he was kissing you, what else transpired? A No more sir. Q What was the position of his body at the time he was kissing you? A He was on top of me and embracing and kissing me. Q What was his body doing while his body was on top of you and kissing you? A His body was trembling, sir. Q Why did you say his body was trembling? A He could not rest because he was kissing me. Q How was his body trembling as you have stated? A It was strong, sir. Q Sidewise or what? A Direct, sir. Q Will you please demonstrate how was his body trembling? A This way, sir (witness demonstrating a forward backward motion) Q Was Dayag wearing a pant at the time he was on top of you? A No, sir. Q What did you notice in his person when he was about to lay on top of you when he was not wearing a pant according to you? A When his pant was removed, he did what he wanted with me, sir. * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * Q Please understand my question. When Ben Dayag lay on top of you, what did he do next aside from kissing and embracing you? A He removed my pantie, sir. Q When Ben Dayag removed your pantie, what next did he do? A He lay on top of me, sir. Q What is that? He just remained there? He laid above you? He was just remaining there, remaining still on top of you? He was still? A He was still. COURT Now proceed. Q What did he do with that penis, if he did anything when you saw it hard? A He put it in. Q Where did he put it in? A To my private parts. Q What were you doing when he was actually putting that private parts to you? A I was lying down, sir. * * * (Italics ours) Her theory of force and intimidation, manifested in her sworn statements of February 12 and 16, 1968, and which rendered her \"unconscious\" is belied by the aforequoted testimony which engenders serious doubt as to the trustworthiness of said statements.  She speaks of resistance, struggle and unconsciousness allegedly caused by force and fear, but complainant was able to give a detailed description of what transpired, including the acts and movements of the accused with all the details.  All these testimonies were supposed to relate to only one incident — that which allegedly occurred on February 5, 1968, at 4:30 P.M., in Barrio Sta. Catalina, Talugtog, Nueva Ecija.  There is absolutely no evidence on record of any mark of violence , bruise or scratch on the body, face or hands of the assailant or of the offended party except those found by Dra. Duval on the latter.  But the swelling and contusions found by the doctor appear to have been caused by blows received from Lourdes' brother and husband and not from herein accused, (TSN Nov. 20, 1968 and February 11, 1969).  The alleged torn dress and panties were not presented in evidence.  Complainant's uncorroborated yarn is not that kind of innocent story of a rape victim on the basis of which one accused of so heinous an offense may be condemned to a living death (People vs. Ariarte, G.R. No. 40736, 60 Phil. 326, 328).  The prosecution, therefore, miserably failed to prove that force and intimidation were really employed by accused to cow the victim to make her submit to his lustful desires.  It is well-settled that — \"Evidence to be believed, must not only proceed from the mouth of a credible witness but it must be credible in itself such as the common experience and observation of mankind can approve as probable under the circumstances.  We have no test of truth of human testimony, except its conformity to our knowledge, observation and experience.  Whatever is repugnant to these belongs to the miraculous, and is outside of juridical cognizance.\" [4] The alibi of accused Ben Dayag, corroborated by his wife, Normacion Pascual, while weak in itself, was never contradicted by the prosecution.  In the case of People vs. Fraga [5] this Court said: \"The rule that alibi must be satisfactorily proven was never intended to change the burden of proof in criminal cases; otherwise, We will see the absurdity of an accused being put in a more difficult position where the prosecution's evidence is vague and weak than where it is strong.\" The onus probandi in establishing the guilt of the accused still rests with the prosecution and in this case We can see that it does not have strong and solid grounds to stand on.  In People vs. Bulawin, 29 SCRA 710, 721, it was ruled thus: \"Of course alibi is known to be the weakest of all defenses.  It is easy to concoct, difficult to disprove.  Nonetheless, where the evidence for the prosecution is weak and betrays lack of concreteness on the question of whether or not defendant is the author of the crime charged, alibi as a defense assumes importance.\" The accused cannot be convicted because of the weakness of his alibi.  The prosecution must prove his guilt by the strength of its evidence and not by the weakness of that of the accused.  During the trial, the prosecution never questioned or impugned the veracity of defendant's alibi and we see no reasonable explanation why both the complainant, Lourdes Cinense, and husband, Juan Pedro, did not refute appellant's testimony that they were all in the barrio hall of barrio Cinense the whole day of February 5, 1968, working on a community project in connection with a beautification contest between barrio Cinense and barrio Casanova. II The defense contends that the complainant took poison not because of the dishonor she allegedly suffered by reason of the rape committed by appellant but because of the maltreatment administered on her person by complainant's own brother, Nolasco Cinense, and her own husband, Juan Pedro, who was jealous of appellant Ben Dayag whom he suspected of having an affair with his wife, Lourdes Cinense.  This was revealed to appellant's wife, Normacion Pascual, who had a conversation with Lourdes in the latter's house early in the morning of February 7, 1968 (T.S.N. pp. 5-6, Jan. 20, 1969).  This incident of maltreatment when she was boxed on the face and kicked was witnessed by Normacion Pascual, wife of accused Ben Dayag, when she was in the house of Rosita Barawid.  (T.S.N. January 20, 1969, pp. 5, 11).  This was corroborated by the Barrio Captain and Dra. Duval who came to know of the maltreatment from Celedonia Cinense, aunt of the victim, who was among those who ran to the rescue of Lourdes Cinense immediately after the attempted suicide and later accompanied Lourdes (in the jeep of the Barrio Captain and with the Barrio Captain himself) to the clinic of Dra. Duval.  It is not true that Lourdes Cinense was taken to the clinic of Dra. Duval on the night of February 5th but on the 7th.  Dra. Nonila Duval who treated Lourdes Cinense testified thus:  (T.S.N. November 20, 1968) * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * \"Q There is an entry here, Doctora, which shows \"ingestion of glacial acetic acid\" and \"big except for swelling and contusions around both eyes, ingestion of glacial acetic acid, contusion face\", will you please explain to us the meaning of this appearing in that card of Lourdes Cinense? A Lourdes Cinense was admitted on complaint of taking acetic acid. This history was gathered from the aunt of the patient. The patient was somewhat in unconscious state and on physical examination, it was noted there was swelling and purphid marks on both eyes, on the face, just below the mouth, anterior chest, upper extremity. Q Doctora, what could have been the cause of those marks that you have explained you have found on the face of Lourdes Cinense? A It may be caused by a bladed instrument. * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * Q Now in that entry it shows also that Lourdes Cinense had a quarrel with her brother, from where did you get that information as appearing in the record? A This was according to the aunt who brought the patient. This is the complete physical examination when she was in the clinic and then that below is the record of the clinic.\" The foregoing, We believe establishes the fact that the maltreatment stated by Celedonia Cinense was no concoction or a figment of the imagination.  And the testimony of Dra. Duval regarding the physical appearance of the patient was likewise not a fabrication nor a \"result of mere insinuation\" as held by the court a quo. III It is undisputed that the alleged victim of rape, Lourdes Cinense, took glacial acetic acid, a poison, and that she was rushed to the clinic of Dra. Nonila Duval in Guimba, the next town.  The date when she took the poison and when she was taken to Guimba is disputed by the prosecution and defense.  Lourdes Cinense averred during the cross-examination that it was February 7th.  She said (T.S.N. September 10, 1968 p. 12): \"Q And is it a fact, Mrs. Cinense, that on February 7, 1968, you were brought at the clinic of Dr. Duval? A Yes, sir. Q And, the person who brought you at the clinic of Dr. Duval was the barrio captain Benjamin Patacsil? A Yes, sir. Q And the driver of the jeep was Gregorio Batong? A Yes, sir. Q And the other persons inside the jeep were Celedonia Cinense, Pedro and your two other children , is that correct? A Yes, sir.\" * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * In the redirect examination We likewise have on record the same complainant saying it was on February 6th.  She said (T.S.N. September 10, 1968 p. 15): \"Q When did you appear in the clinic of Dra. Duval? A After I had drunk, I was taken there directly. Q When was that? A That was after the incident happened to me. Q You took the poison on February 6, the following day when you were abused by Ben Dayag? A Yes, sir. Q Were you able to go home that same day after you went to the clinic of Dra. Duval? A No, sir. On the other hand, Dra. Nonila Duval, referring to her clinical records, testified as follows on November 20, 1968: (T.S.N.) \"Q In this card it shows the following: \"2-7-68, Lourdes Cinense.\" What does this mean? A She was admitted on that date, sir. Lourdes Cinense was admitted on February 7, 1968. * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * Q Was that the first time, Doctora, that Lourdes Cinense entered your clinic, February 7, 1968? A Yes, sir. Q In your records, Doctora, when did Lourdes Cinense come out of your clinic? A February 10, 1968, sir. Q And so she stayed in your clinic for three days? A Yes, sir two and a half. Q Is this the only record that you have, the card? A No, this is the clinical record. Q Let me see. There is an entry in this record Doctora which reads as follows: \"2-7-68, Admitted for the first time is a 38 years old young woman with a CC of ingestion of glacial acetic acid as a result with a quarrel with the brother. General appearance — patient seems to be in an unconscious state as she does not respond to questions and other stimuli but on raising the left upper extremity over the face and then suddenly letting it fall, the hand falls to the side of the body an evidence that she is not really in a comatose state. Skin, presence of swelling in areas of ecchymosis around both eyes, face anterior chest, and upper extremities.\" Will you please explain to us, Doctora, what does that entry appearing thereat mean? A Patient, when she came, was somewhat unconscious. To determine the unconsciousness, we used physical stimulation like pinching, and if she does not respond to the stimuli we raise the hand. If the patient is really unconscious, the hands fall on the face, but if the unconsciousness is not very deep then the hands fall on the side.\" After delving into the record, We have arrived at the conclusion that the testimony of Dra. Duval is credible.  For We do not find any reason or motive why she would falsify her clinical records.  It is undisputed that she prepared the card on the very day the complainant was admitted, which was on the 7th, and not on the 5th or 6th as prosecution would like it to appear.  The testimony of Dra. Duval was corroborated by none other than that of the Barrio Captain, Benjamin Patacsil, who accompanied Lourdes Cinense to Dra. Duval's clinic and whose jeep was used in conducting her to the same.  Significant too is the fact that Barrio Captain Patacsil is the nephew of Juan Pedro, husband of Lourdes Cinense (T.S.N. September 11, 1968 p. 8) and, therefore, the Barrio Captain could not have contrived lies to contradict the testimony of his aunt-in-law.  Barrio Captain Benjamin Patacsil testified as follows:  (T.S.N. February 11, 1969) \"Q Are you the same Benjamin Patacsil subpoenaed in this case against the accused Ben Dayag? A Yes, sir. Q On February 7, 1968, do you have any government position? A I was the barrio captain of Barrio Cinense, sir. Q On that date at 7:00 o'clock in the evening, do you remember where were you? A Yes, sir. Q Where were you? A I was at barrio Cinense, Talugtog, sir. Q At around six in the evening or afternoon of February 7, 1968, do you remember having gone somewhere? A We took Lourdes Cinense to Dra. Duval, sir. Q How come you brought Lourdes Cinense to Dra. Duval? A Arsenio Pedro called us because of an emergency, sir. Q Who is this Arsenio Pedro? A Brother of Juan Pedro, sir. Q What did Juan Pedro tell you when he came to you? A He told me to deliver Lourdes Cinense to Dra. Duval because of her taking poison, sir. Q What did you do when informed about that? A I told my driver to give my jeep to them or take them to my jeep that afternoon, sir. Q Why, do you have a jeep? A Yes, sir. Q Did you bring Lourdes to Dra. Duval as requested by Arsenio Pedro? A Yes, sir. Q When you brought Lourdes to the place of Dra. Duval, who were your companions, if any? A My companions were the driver, Celedonia Cinense, Hilaria Pedro and two children of Lourdes Cinense. Q How about Lourdes Cinense? A She was taken to Dra. Duval, sir. Q What is the name of your driver? A Gregorio Batong, sir. Q When you were in the jeep as Barrio Captain, what did you do? A I asked Celedonia Cinense what was the cause of the matter. Q What answer was given by Celedonia Cinense if any? A She said that her brother Nolasco Cinense repeatedly boxed Lourdes Cinense, sir. Q What was the condition of Lourdes Cinense when you saw her and you were bringing her to Dra. Duval's place? A Her face was swollen and she was vomiting, sir. * * *                                        * * *                                          * * * The rejection by the Trial Judge of Dra. Duval's testimony, supported as it is with records duly signed by her, on the sole ground that the doctor wrote the date on the line which bears the sign:  \"Binding margin, do not write here,\" is based on a flimsy and hollow justification.  In the usual course of business there are occasions when one inadvertently writes on a restricted space such as the one aforementioned. There is one incident the significance of which runs counter to the usual pattern of human behavior and normal reaction in times of stress.  Reference is made to the fact that immediately after the occurrence of the foiled suicide by herein complainant, when the Barrio Captain was called for and the patient was brought to the hospital, no report to him was made about the commission of rape by appellant as the impelling factor for the attempted suicide.  What Celedonia Cinense, an aunt of the victim, related to the Barrio Captain is that Lourdes took poison after a quarrel between Lourdes and her brother, Nolasco Cinense, and the former was maltreated by his brother and by her husband himself, Juan Pedro.  (T.S.N. February 11, 1969 p. 11) This narration was repeated to Dra. Duval when the latter took the history of the case.  In a small barrio as Cinense news about crimes against chastity, as the alleged attack against the complainant herein, spread like wildfire and will certainly not escape the ears of everyone, much less the Barrio Captain who is highly regarded as a person in authority therein.  But nowhere in the record was the matter of rape reported nor mentioned to the barrio captain or to Dra. Duval either by the aunt or the children of Lourdes who, according to her husband, Juan Pedro, were called immediately after their mother was raped by Dayag.  Lourdes Cinense testified too that when she took poison, her son, Nonito Pedro, 15 years of age, was around.  (Summary Statement of February 16, 1968 before the municipal court of Talugtog). The above circumstances cast a heavy pall of doubt on the prosecution's evidence that rape was committed on the person of the complainant, or that the accused committed the same. \"Of course We are agreed, that no woman in her right senses would concoct such a tale repugnant to her virtue, and undergo the rigors of a public trial covering her very honor, but this is no guaranty that all self-inflicted indignities are for the sake of truth\" [6] for the books disclose too many instances of false charges of rape, attempted rape and kindred offenses to permit the courts to enter a judgment of conviction of a crime of this nature without having in mind the possibility that the complaining witness may have been actuated by some sinister motive in bringing the charge.  On the other hand, the only evidence on which convictions of these heinous offenses can be had is frequently the uncorroborated testimony of the injured woman, ... It becomes necessary, therefore, for the courts to exercise the most painstaking care in scrutinizing the testimony of the witnesses for the prosecution.\" [7] Rape is a most detestable crime, and therefore ought severely and impartially to be punished with death; but it must be remembered that it is an accusation easy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accused, though innocent.'' [8] Having considered the above factors and having read and re-read the record and weighed the evidence presented, We hold that the guilt of the accused has not been established beyond reasonable doubt. WHEREFORE, We vote to reverse the judgment appealed from, acquit the defendant of the crime charged and order his release from custody, unless he is held for some other lawful cause.  Costs d e oficio.

D E C I S I O N MENDOZA, J.: This is an appeal from the decision, [1] dated February 11, 1993, :d the Regional Trial Court, Branch 97 of Quezon City rendered in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-92-28785 to 86 and Q-92-31157 to 31160, finding accused-appellant Marcelino Bugarin guilty of four counts of consummated rape and one count of attempted rape and sentencing him as follows: WHEREFORE, this Court finds the accused GUILTY beyond reasonable doubt as charged of multiple (3 Counts) rape and one count of attempted rape, and in accordance with Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code sentences him to prison terms as follows: 1)For each of the four counts of the above rape, reclusion perpetua. 2)For the attempted rape, two (2) years and four (4) months in the minimum penalty to four (4) years in the maximum period and to indemnify the private complainant in the amount of P50,000.00 as moral damages and exemplary damages of P50,000.00 to deter sexual crimes of the sort committed by accused. SO ORDERED. The complainant, Maryjane Bugarin, is the daughter of accused-appellant. On February 22, 1992, accompanied by her mother, Regina Bugarin, and her maternal aunt, Nena Padecio, she complained to the Central Police District Command that she had been repeatedly raped by accused-appellant. In her sworn statement she related how, on nine different occasions between November 1989 and January 17, 1992, her father entered the common sleeping area of their house in Payatas, Quezon City and, after holding her knees and spreading her legs, succeeded in inserting his penis into her vagina and kissed her breasts. She claimed that, on January 17, 1992, her father molested her by \"kissing her vagina\" and that only by repeatedly kicking him did he desist from molesting her any further. Complainant was examined on the same date by Emmanuel I. Aranas, PNP Medico-Legal Officer, who found that she was \"in non-virgin state physically.\" [2] On February 25, 1992, she returned to the police station to file formal charges against her father. The case was referred to the Office of the Quezon City Prosecutor which found probable cause and accordingly filed charges for consummated rape and attempted rape by means of force and intimidation committed on December 23,  1991 and January 17, 1992 against accused-appellant Marcelino Bugarin. No bail was recommended \"considering that the evidence of guilt of the respondent is strong.\" The cases were docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. Q-92-28785 and Q-92-28786 and raffled to Branch 88 of the Quezon City Regional Trial Court. On May 7, 1992, four more charges for rape by means of force and intimidation committed on November 1989, May 1990, June 1990, and March 14, 1991 were filed against accused-appellant, Docketed as Criminal Cases Nos. Q-92-31157 to 31160, the additional cases were raffled to Branch 97 of the same court. These cases were eventually consolidated and assigned to Branch 88. The informations in the six cases alleged as follows: Crim Case No. 92-31157 That on or about the month of June 1990 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned MARY JANE BUGARIN y ASUNCION, a minor, 15 years of age, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the latter. The crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of relationship. Crim. Case No. 92-31158 That on or about the month of November, 1989 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully and feloniously have camal knowledge with the undersigned MARY JANE BUGARIN y ASUNCION without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the latter. The crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of relationship. Crim. Case No. 92-31159 That on or about the 14th day of March, 1991 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused, by means of force and intimidation, did then and there, wilfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned MARYJANE BUGARIN y ASUNCION, a minor, 15 years of age, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the latter. The crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of relationship. Crim. Case No. 92-31160 That on or about the month of May 1990 in Quezon City, Philippines, the said accused by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully and feloniously have carnal knowledge of the undersigned MARYJANE BUGARIN y ASUNCION, a minor, 15 years of age, without her consent and against her will, to the damage and prejudice of the latter. The crime was attended by the aggravating circumstance of relationship. Crim. Case No. 92-28785 That on or about the 17th day of January, 1992, in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously commence the commission of the crime of Rape directly by overt acts, by then and there kissing the nipples and the vagina of the undersigned MARYJANE BUGARIN Y ASUNCION, a minor, and about to lay on top of her, all against her will, however, the said accused did not perform all the acts of execution which would have produced the crime of Rape by reason of some causes other than his own spontaneous desistance, that is, undersigned complainant push him away, to the damage and prejudice of the undersigned in such amount as may be awarded to her under the provisions of the New Civil Code. Crim. Case No. 92-28786 That on or about the 23\"1 day of December, 1991, in Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the above-named accused, with lewd designs and by means of force and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have sexual intercourse with the undersigned MARYJANE  BUGARIN  Y   ASUNCION,   a  minor,   without  her consent and against her will, to her damage and prejudice in such amount as may be awarded to her under the provisions of the New Civil Code. Upon arraignment, accused-appellant pleaded not guilty in each case, after which trial ensued. Under questioning by the prosecutor, Maryjane Bugarin narrated how her father sexually assaulted her in their family's common sleeping area while no one was at home and threatened her if she told anyone about what happened. Accused-appellant denied the charges against him. He claimed to be God fearing and morally upright and that his wife, Regina Bugarin, must have induced their daughter to file the complaints against him because his wife blamed him for financially neglecting their family since 1989. In rebuttal, the prosecution presented Regina Bugarin who testified that a good mother would not expose her child to humiliation just to get back at her husband. She further claimed that her daughter, who had been raised properly and taught to be honest, could not have fabricated the charges against the accused-appellant. In a two-page decision, promulgated on February 11, 1993, the trial court, after giving a summary of the testimonies of the complainant and accused-appellant, laconically ruled: The issue is simple. Is the private complainant credible in her story of how she was raped? The answer of this Court is an undoubtful and a definite yes. Accused-appellant questions the trial court's decision on the ground that: (1) the testimony of Maryjane Bugarin is not credible; (2) the elements of force and intimidation had not been proved; and (3) the decision of the trial court does not state the facts and law upon which it was based. On the other hand, the Solicitor General, representing the prosecution, contends that complainant, who was only 15 years old when she reported the crime, was not likely to concoct charges against her father and that the moral ascendancy of the father over her took the place of force and intimidation in rape. We take up first accused-appellant's charge that the decision of the trial court does not state the grounds therefor. Indeed, the Constitution provides in part in Art. VIII, § 14 that \"No decision shall be rendered by any court without expressing therein clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which it is based.\" This requirement is reiterated and implemented by the 1985 Rules of Criminal Procedure which provides in Rule 120, §2: Sec. 2. Form and contents of judgment. - The judgment must be written in the official language, personally and directly prepared by the judge and signed by him and shall contain clearly and distinctly a statement of the facts proved or admitted by the accused and the law upon which the judgment is based.. If it is of conviction, the judgment shall state (a) the legal qualification of the offense constituted by the acts committed by the accused, and the aggravating or mitigating circumstances attending the commission thereof, if there are any; (b) the participation of the accused in the commission of the offense, whether as principal, accomplice, or accessory after the fact; (c) the penalty imposed upon the accused; and (d) the civil liability or damages caused by the wrongful act to be recovered from the accused by the offended party, if there is any, unless the enforcement of the civil liability by a separate action has been reserved or waived. In case of acquittal, unless there is a clear showing that the act from which the civil liability might arise did not exist, the judgment shall make a finding on the civil liability of the accused in favor of the offended party. The decision of the trial court falls short of this requirement in at least three respects. First, it does not contain an evaluation of the evidence of the parties and a discussion of the legal questions involved. It does not explain why the trial court considered the complainant's testimony credible despite the fact that, as accused-appellant points out, complainant could not remember the time of the day when she was allegedly raped. It does not explain why accused-appellant's licking of complainant's genital constituted attempted rape and not another crime. Second, the complainant testified that she had been raped five times, to wit, in November 1989, on December 24, 1989, in June 1990, on March 14, 1991, and on December 23, 1991, and that once, on January 17, 1992, she was molested by her father who licked her private part, for which reason six informations were filed against him, but the decision found the accused-appellant guilty of only four counts of rape (which the trial court erroneously said three counts) and one count of attempted rape, without explaining whether accused-appellant was being acquitted of one charge of rape. Third, the decision is so carelessly prepared that it finds the accused-appellant guilty of three counts of consummated rape but sentences him to suffer the penalty of reclusion perpetua \"for each of the four counts of   ... rape.\" Maryjane claimed she had been raped on December 24, 1989, but the information in Criminal Case No. Q-92-31160 is for rape allegedly committed in May 1990. It must be for this reason that the trial court convicted accused-appellant of only four counts of rape, instead of five. But the trial court should have explained so, if this was really the reason, and expressly acquitted the accused-appellant of the charge under this information. The requirement that the decisions of courts must be in writing and that they must set forth clearly and distinctly the facts and the law on which they are based serves many functions. It is intended, among other things, to inform the parties of the reason or reasons for the decision so that if any of them appeals, he can point out to the appellate court the findings of facts or the rulings on points of law with which he disagrees. More than that, the requirement is an assurance to the parties that, in reaching judgment, the judge did so through the processes of legal reasoning. It is, thus, a safeguard against the impetuosity of the judge, preventing him from deciding by ipse dixit . Vouchsafed neither the sword nor the purse by the Constitution but nonetheless vested with the sovereign prerogative of passing judgment on the life, liberty or property of his fellowmen, the judge must ultimately depend on the power of reason for sustained public confidence in the justness of his decision. The decision of the trial court in this case disrespects the judicial function. We would normally remand this case to the trial court for compliance with the constitutional requirement for decisions. But this case has been pending for sometime and further delay can be avoided if the Court simply reviews the whole evidence. After all, the records of the trial court contain the transcript of stenographic notes, the complainant's sworn statement dated February 22, 1992, the resolution of the prosecutor, and the statement of the arresting officer, on the basis of which the Court may properly decide the case. [3] For this reason the Court has decided to review this case despite the failure of the trial court to make detailed findings of facts and a statement of the reasons underlying its decision. Now it is settled that when the complainant in a rape case, more so if she is a minor, [4] testifies that she has been raped, she says, in effect, all that is necessary to prove the commission of the crime. [5] Card must be taken, however, that her testimony is credible for a conviction to be justified based on her testimony alone. [6] In this case, Maryjane Bugarin testified on November 25, 19927 as follows: Q-     On November 1989, was your father residing with you or was he living with you? A-    Yes, sir. Q-     Now,  on  November,   1989  do you  remember  any  unusual incident that happened, if any? A-     Yes, sir, when he entered the room. Q-     When you say \"he,\" are you referring to Marcelino Bugarin? A-     Yes, sir. Q-     If Marcelino Bugann is present today, would you be able to identify him? A-     Yes, sir. (witness is pointing to a man wearing a green t-shirt who answers by the name Marcelino Bugarin when asked by the Court). Q- On November 1989, you were mentioning that \"he\", referring to the accused, entered your room, what happened? A- (witness crying) When he entered the room, he embraced me and touched the different parts of my body and he informed me that when I grow up, I would not become innocent. Q-     What do you mean by those words that he told you that when you grow up you would not be innocent? A-     So that when I grow up I will know what he will be doing. Q-     What did he do? \"People v. Vitor, 245 SCRA 392 (1995). 5See People v. Tabao. 240 SCRA 757 (1995); U.S. v. Ramos, 1 Phil. 181 (1906). 6People v. Ching, 240 SCRA 267 (1995); People v. Biendo, 216 SCRA 626 (1992). 7TSN,pp. 3-4, Nov. 25, 1992. A-    He touched my knees and spread them out and then holding my breast and he put his sex organ inside me. Q-     When you say inside me, what do you mean? A-     His sex organ entered my what, I am fertile. Q-     What do you mean by what? A-     My sex organ, sir. Q-     What did you do when your father tried to put his sex organ to your sex organ? A-     I was trying to push his body away from me, and I said to him, father, I don't like it, ayoko po. Q-     Despite your pleas, what happened next? A-     He still continued what he is doing, and when I fainted, he suddenly moved back. Q-     After he moved back, what transpired afterwards? A-     He went out and I was left crying. Q-     After this first incident, were there any other similar incident which happened, if any? A-     There are, sir, but I can't recall when. Q-     How many times more or less? A-     Around four (4) times. Q-     After November 1989? A-     Including November 1989. Q-     How about on December 24, 1989, do you remember where you were? A-    Yes, sir. I was in our house. Q-     Do you remember any unusual or extraordinary incident that happened on December 24, 1989? A-     Yes, sir. It is the same thing that he did to me. Q-     Please explain what the same thing he do to you? A-     He embraced and kissed me on my cheek, my neck and also my breast. Q-     What happened next? A-     He was spreading my legs. Q-    Then, after spreading your legs, what did the accused do? A-     He let his sex organ touched my sex organ. Q-     After that, what happened next? A-     I cried again. Q-     When you cried again, what did your father do, if any? A-     His face became scaring. Q-     Now, after December 24, 1989 incident, do you remember where you were sometime in June 1990? A-     I was in our house. Q-     Specifically, in June of 1990, do you remember any unusual incident that happened? A-     The same thing happened, over and over. Q-     What do you mean by the same thing happened, over and over? A-    He would embraced me and then kissed me and touched my breast and kissed my nipples. Q-     And, besides in embracing, kissing and kissing your nipples, what else did your father do on June 1990? A-     He kissed also my sex organ. Q-     Beside kissing your sex organ, what else did he do, if any? A-     He placed inside my sex organ his sex organ. Q-    In March 14, 1991, where were you? A-     I was also in our house. Q-     Do you remember what happened, if any, On March 14, 1991? A-     That's it again, I was in the room and again he embraced me made me lie down then kiss my sex organ and then, he placed again his sex organ inside my sex organ. Q-     How about December 23, 1991, do you remember where you were? A-    I was also in the house. Q-     What happened? A-     I was lying down and he lied there beside me and told me to accede to his desire. Q-     What do you mean to accede to his desire? A-     He wanted to use me again. Q-    Then, he actually used you? A-    Yes, sir. Q-     Now, on January 17, 1992, do you remember where you were? A-     I was also in our house. Q-     Would you kindly tell what happened in your house on this day? A-     He licked my sex organ. Q-    After that, what did he do next9 A-    He was threatening me. Q-    What did you do when he threatened you? A-    I was so afraid, (witness is crying) Q-    What did the accused to after threatening you? A-    He was doing nothing. He was just walking beside me. Q-    What happened after you saw him walking just beside you on that date? A-    None, sir. I was just crying. The accused-appellant claims that Maryjane's testimony contains inconsistencies which indicate that the charges against him were fabricated. He points to the failure of complainant on cross-examination to state in some instances the exact date and time she was allegedly raped, and to the fact that it took complainant two years before reporting the incidents and that the prosecution did not present the medico-legal officer who examined the complainant. Accused-appellant also claims that no evidence was adduced to prove that the rape was committed by force and intimidation. The failure of the complainant to state in some cases the exact date and time of the commission of rape is a minor matter and can be expected when a witness is recounting the details of a humiliating experience which are painful and difficult to recall in open court and in the presence of other people. [8] Indeed, this Court has ruled that complainant's failure to recall some details of the crime, instead of suggesting prevarication, precisely indicates spontaneity and is to be expected from a witness who is of tender age and unaccustomed to court proceedings. Besides, the date of the commission of the rape is not an essential element of the crime. [9] The precise time of the crime has no substantial bearing on its commission, [10] especially since in this case the date and time of the commission of the crime is not material to the accused-appellant's defense. Indeed, accused-appellant's contention is only that he could not have raped his daughter in the common bedroom at nighttime because the place where they sleep is shut off from the rest of their house by a curtain. Suffice it to state that lust is no respecter of time and place. [11] Our cases record instances of rape committed inside family dwellings when other occupants are asleep. [12] In the case at bar, Maryjane testified that the accused-appellant was able to rape her by sending out her siblings to play with their neighbors' children , and while her mother was at work from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Complainant explained her apparent inability to recall the exact dates of the assaults upon her, thus: Q- Madam witness, you mentioned that you were raped sometime November 1989, June 1990, December 24, 1989, March 14, 1991, December 23, 1991, how come that you knew very well the date as December 24, March 14, December 23; or rather, how come that your complaint is only sometime in the early partofl991? A- I remember because that was closed to the birthday of my brother. Q-       How about March 14, how come you knew very well that you were molested by your father? A-        Because at that time, our class will almost end and we were given clearances. Q-       What day is your last school day? A-        I cannot remember, sir. Q-     Is it usual that you knew veiy well March 14, and you do not know very well your last day of your school day? A-       Because March 14 is our clearance. Neither does the delay in making a criminal accusation impair the credibility of a witness if such delay is satisfactorily explained.1 In People v. Cobma, [14] where the complainant was also only 13 years old when first molested by her father, the Court adverted to the father's moral and physical control over the young complainant in explaining the delay of eight years before the complaint against her father was made. In this case, Maryjane must have been overwhelmed by fear and confusion, and shocked that her own father had defiled her. After all, she had been very close to him. She also testified that she was afraid to tell her mother because the latter might be angered, so that she finally confided to her aunt. Indeed, a survey conducted by the University of the Philippines Center for Women 's Studies showed that victims of rape committed by their fathers took much longer in reporting the incidents to the authorities than did other victims. Many factors account for this difference: the fact that the father lives with the victim and constantly exerts moral authority over her, the threat he might make against her, the victim's fear of her mother and other relatives. Nor is it entirely true that no evidence of force and intimidation had been adduced during the trial. Maryjane testified that she tried to resist her father's advances but, on several occasions, she was overpowered by him. She was embraced and thus prevented from escaping. [15] At other times she was intimidated by menacing looks cast on her [16] and by threats of harm. [17] Indeed, even if there was no violence or force employed against her, the moral influence of accused-appellant over the complainant sufficed to make the crime rape. [18] Nor is a medical examination an indispensable element in prosecutions for rape. [19] That the prosecution did not present the medico-legal officer is, therefore, not an obstacle to a finding of guilt in this case. We think the evidence in this case proves beyond all reasonable doubt that Maryjane had been raped on four occasions by accused-appellant: November 1989, June 1990, March 14, 1991, and December 23, 1991. Complainant has no motive to incriminate her father. To the contrary, she testified that she was close to him. The absence of a motive lends greater credence to her testimony. [20] Neither does her mother have any reason to falsely accuse Marcelino Bugarin. Regina Bugarin suspected her husband of having an affair with her sister in 1980 and confronted him, but she continued to live with him. This fact makes it unlikely that she would use her daughter to destroy her husband more than ten years later. A mother would not expose her child to public trial, if the charges she makes are not true. [21] We find no evidence, however, to find accused-appellant guilty of the charge in Criminal Case No. Q-92-31160 for alleged rape committed in May 1990. There is no evidence to prove that accused-appellant raped complainant on that date. Her testimony is to the effect that she was raped on another date, December 24, 1989. But accused-appellant cannot be convicted for this as no complaint was formally filed regarding it. Accused-appellant must accordingly be acquitted of the charge in Criminal Case No. Q-92-31160. Nor do we think that accused-appellant is guilty of attempted rape committed on January 17, 1992 as the trial court held. Maryjane testified: Q-    Now, on January 17, 1992, do you remember where you were? A-    I was also in our house. Q-    Would you kindly tell what happened in your house on this day? A-    He licked my sex organ. Q-    After that, what did he do next? A-    He was threatening me. Q-    What did you do when he threatened you? A-    I was so afraid, (witness is crying) Q-    What did the accused to after threatening you? A-    He was doing nothing. He was just walking beside me. Q-    What happened after you saw him walking just beside you on that date? A-    None, sir. I was just crying. The intent to commit rape is not apparent from the act described. It cannot be inferred from this act (licking complainant's genital) alone that his intention was to have sexual intercourse with her because it has not been shown that he had at least placed himself on top of the complainant. [22] The act imputed to him cannot be considered a preparatory act to sexual intercourse. [23] Accused-appellant is instead guilty of acts of lasciviousness. It can at least be inferred from his act of kissing the genital of the complainant that he was moved by lewd designs. [24] Although relationship, as an aggravating circumstance, is alleged only in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-92-31157 to 31160, this circumstance was nonetheless proved during the trial in Criminal Case No. Q-92-28785 and, therefore, should also be appreciated in that case to justify the imposition of the penalty in its maximum period. WHEREFORE , the decision dated February 11, 1993 of the Regional Trial Court of Quezon City is SET ASIDE and another one is RENDERED finding accused-appellant Marcelino Bugarin GUILTY of four counts of consummated rape in Criminal Cases Nos. Q-92-28786, Q-92-31157, Q-92-31158, and Q-92-31159 and SENTENCED to reclusion perpetua and ORDERED to INDEMNIFY the complainant Maryjane Bugarin in the amount of P30,000.00 in damages for each count of rape committed; and of acts of lasciviousness in Criminal Case No. Q-92-28785, for which he is SENTENCED to suffer imprisonment from 6 months of arresto mayor, as minimum, to six 6 years of prision correctional, as maximum. In Criminal Case No. Q-92-31160, accused-appellant is hereby ACQUITTED. SO ORDERED. Puno, and Mendoza, JJ., concur. Regalado, (Chairman), J., No part; formerly connected with private respondent.

      "- 393 Phil. 338 [ G.R No. 133859. August 24, 2000 ] PEOPLE OF THE PHILIPPINES, PLAINTIFF-APPELLEE, VS. FELIZARDO GONZALES Y ALTARES, ACCUSED-APPELLANT. D E C I S I O N PER CURIAM: This case illustrates how parental neglect could sometimes lead children to tragic ends. The victim in this case, a 12-year old girl, was forced to live with her father's relatives when her parents succumbed to social pressure. Her father was in jail for peddling narcotics; her mother worked as a domestic helper in some foreign land. And in their absence, her very own uncle took advantage of her youth and naivete’. He is now on the verge of death, as society seeks to preserve itself from inner devastation. On 3 March 1998, a decision [1] was rendered in Criminal Case No. 97-18570 by the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City, Branch 50, finding herein accused-appellant Felizardo Gonzales y Altares (hereafter FELIZARDO) guilty of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the ultimate penalty of death. The following facts, proved by the prosecution and culled from the records of the case, demonstrate how the case found its way to this Court for automatic review. Katherine M. Gonzales (hereafter KATHERINE) was born on 10 October 1984 to the spouses Leopoldo Gonzales and Remedios Makilan. [2] At the time of the first incident, she had just turned twelve (12) years old and was in the graduating elementary class of the Negros Occidental High School (NOHS) in Murcia, Negros Occidental. Two years prior to the incident, she and her five elder brothers began living with their paternal grandmother, Herminia Gonzales, at Alunan-Yulo Street, Bacolod City, because their father Leopoldo was serving a prison sentence at the National Penitentiary on a drug conviction, while their mother Remedios was in Qatar, working as a domestic helper. They shared the house with their uncle FELIZARDO, Leopoldo's younger brother, and cousin Joan, the illegitimate daughter of their Aunt Titing. They also shared one room at the ground floor of Herminia's house. KATHERINE, Joan, and their \"Mama Minyang\" occupied the biggest bed, a \"matrimonial\" bed with only a mat for a mattress. About one arm's length away, her, brothers Renpol and Richard slept on a smaller bed with FELIZARDO. Her two other brothers, Ruel and Reggie, occupied the other bed, which is behind the cabinet (\" aparador \") serving as a divider. [3] The first incident occurred on 29 October 1996. Herminia woke up KATHERINE at around 4:00 a.m., as she usually did, so that the latter could close the door and turn off the lights when she left for the Libertad Market to shop for goods to be peddled. After complying with her grandmother's instructions, KATHERINE went back to their room. She was surprised to see her \"Uncle Zardo,\" who was holding a flashlight in the dark room. Thereupon, FELIZARDO asked her if she really had a tattoo on her breast and pushed her to the bed where Joan was sleeping. FELIZARDO moved Joan to the edge of the bed, then went on top of KATHERINE, holding her hands together. She struggled and tried to shout, but FELIZARDO covered and squeezed her mouth, at the same time threatening to kill her and her brothers. He took off her T-shirt (chemise), shorts, and panty. With KATHERINE naked, FELIZARDO spread her legs, focused the light on her vagina before licking it, and sucked her nipples. Moments later, FELIZARDO removed his shorts and briefs, again straddled KATHERINE, inserted his penis into her vagina, then performed the sexual act for about five minutes. She felt excruciating pain in her organ and begged him to stop; which he did, but only after he had ejaculated. KATHERINE felt something slippery run down her vagina. His nefarious deed accomplished, FELIZARDO stood up, trained the flashlight on KATHERINE's organ, then ordered her to wash. [4] KATHERINE distinctly remembered her first ordeal not only because it happened two days after the birthday of her brother and cousin Joan, but because she experienced her first menstruation the day after, October 30th. [5] Such violation was repeated on the 5th, 6th, and 9th of April 1997. [6] Likewise, KATHERINE clearly remembered these dates because she graduated from elementary on 3 April 1997. He employed the same modus operandi each time: when Patricia had left for the market and KATHERINE, had gone back to sleep after closing the door and turning off the light, FELIZARDO would crawl toward her. First, he would move Joan aside, then he would undress KATHERINE, suck her nipples, lick her vagina, and rape her. He never kissed her lips. [7] Her brothers never woke up whenever FELIZARDO performed his evil acts because they were \"heavy sleepers.\" [8] The last incident, which is the subject of this case, occurred on 15 August 1997. On this, KATHERINE made the following narration: Q. After April 9, was there any other incidents? A. Yes, sir. Q. When was that? A. On August 15, 1997, the last incident. Q. Will you please tell this Honorable Court why were you able to know this date, August 15, 1997? A. Because that was a Friday and the following Monday, that was the time when I complained to somebody. Q. On August 15, 1997, what time did the accused rape you? A. Same time, 4:00 a.m. Q. Do you want to convey to this Honorable Court that the accused used to rape you at 4:00 a.m.? A. Yes, sir. Q. Also on October 29, 1996, April 5, 6, 9 and August 15, 1997? A. Yes, sir. Q. This incident happened while your grandmother Herminia was out because she was going to the market? A. Yes, sir. Q. And your Lola Menyang used to wake you up whenever she goes to the market? A. Yes, sir. Q. Were you always the one who was tasked to close the door whenever she left the house? A. Yes, sir COURT: Q. So, what happened on August 15, 1997, would you narrate? A. The same. FISCAL ESQUILLA: Q. What happened, when you said the same thing happened? A. The same, he would crawl towards me and raped (sic) me. COURT: Q. The August 15 incident is the subject matter of this case. You tell us everything that happened. Do not touch on any other dates. A. On August 15, I was sleeping then when I noticed that somebody was putting aside Joan but I did not mind because I fall (sic) asleep again. Before I knew it, I was surprised when he was already at my feet. FISCAL ESQUILLA: Q. Whom are you referring to that he was at your feet? A. Felizardo Gonzales. COURT: Q. How do you call him? A. Tito Zardo. FISCAL ESQUILLA: Q. So, please narrate to this Court after that when the accused was at your feet? A. Before he would do anything, he would tell me not to shout or make any noise because he will kill my brothers. So, the same thing, what he had done to me previously, he did it again on that day. Q. After the accused told you not to shout for if you shout he will kill your brothers, what did the accused do after that? A. He undressed me again, he pulled off my short pants and panty and spread my legs. Q. After that, what happened next? A. He licked my vagina. Q. How about your breast? A. He sucked my breast. COURT: Q. He did this [sic] to you one at a time, alternately or what? A. First, he licked my vagina, and mashed my breast. Q. And after that on that particular morning, on August 15, 1997, after the accused mashed your breast, licked your vagina, what did the accused further do to you? A. He was on top of me and made a motion of push and pull and forced his penis to insert in my vagina. Q. Did you feel that penis of the accused penetrated [sic] your vagina? A. Yes, sir. Q. If you know, and what you feel, the entire penis was inside your vagina? A. Yes, the entire length of his penis. Q. What did you do? A. I was struggling. Q. How long did he stay on top of you while moving this push and pull? A. Not less than five (5) minutes. Q. So, you said that after he completely have [sic] a sexual intercourse with you, what happened next? A. No more. Q. What did he tell you, if any? A. After that, he instructed me to dress up? [sic] [9] On 18 August 1997, KATHERINE finally found the will and courage to relate to somebody what FELIZARDO had done to her. She narrated her harrowing experience to her classmates, Claire Vingco and Rosemary Quiatchon. In turn, Rosemarie relayed the information to her mother Gilda, who happened to be a teacher and, in fact, was KATHERINE's adviser at the NOHS. Gilda brought KATHERINE to the GABRIELLA [10] Center. Gilda and a certain Yolly Macaya of GABRIELLA accompanied KATHERINE to the house of her maternal grandmother, Patricia Makilan, located at Barangay Minoyan, Murcia, Negros Occidental. They informed her that KATHERINE had been raped by her uncle FELIZARDO. KATHERINE's case was then referred to the Women 's and Children 's Desk of the Bacolod City Police Office (BCPO). [11] Dr. Joy Ann Jocson, medico-legal officer at the Bacolod City Health Office, conducted a physical examination on KATHERINE. Her findings, contained in her medical report dated 18 August 1997, revealed that KATHERINE had incomplete lacerations at the 7 and 9 o'clock positions. [12] Her cervix admitted two (2) fingers and her hymen was partially lacerated, suggesting prior sexual intercourse. Dr. Jocson also said that during the examination, KATHERINE divulged that she had been raped \"many times\" between 29 October 1996 and 15 August 1997. [13] SPO2 Evelyn M. Mabayag, who was assigned at the Women 's Desk of the BCPO, confirmed the testimony of KATHERINE on the circumstances surrounding the rape charge. [14] After taking the statements of KATHERINE and Patricia, she was convinced that the crime charged was indeed committed. SPO2 Mabayag then prepared the complaint, [15] which was signed by KATHERINE and Patricia. On the strength of said complaint, FELIZARDO was apprehended on the same date at their house by a team composed of SPO2 Mabayag, SPO4 Carmencita Saliba, two investigators and a mobile group. [16] On 22 August 1997, SPO2 Mabayag conducted an ocular inspection of the place of the incident and found the arrangement of the beds at the ground floor of Patricia Makilan's house to be consistent with KATHERINE'S description. [17] After due proceedings, a complaint [18] was filed with the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City on 22 August 1997, charging FELIZARDO with rape allegedly committed as follows: That on or about the 15th day of August, 1997, in the City of Bacolod, Philippines, and within the jurisdiction of this Honorable Court, the herein accused, by means of force, violence and intimidation, did then and there wilfully, unlawfully and feloniously have incestuous carnal knowledge of his niece, the herein complainant, KATHERINE Gonzales y Makilan, 12 years of age, against the latter's will. ACTS CONTRARY TO LAW. The case, docketed as Criminal Case No. 97-18570, was raffled off to Branch 50 of the Regional Trial Court of Negros Occidental, Bacolod City. During arraignment, FELIZARDO entered a plea of not guilty. FELIZARDO denied the accusation against him and declared that he could not have raped or molested KATHERINE at 4:00 in the morning of 15 August 1997 because he was sleeping at the time. His mother Herminia usually woke him up after 5:00 a.m. KATHERINE's claim that he raped her at 4:00 a.m. was, therefore, false and incredible. He was not even aware of any reason why KATHERINE' would point to him as the culprit when, in fact, he had never touched her. [19] Herminia Gonzales believed in her son's innocence and said FELIZARDO could never have committed such a thing. During the time the rape was allegedly committed, she was still in the house preparing their breakfast, leaving only at around 5:30 to 6:00 each morning to do her marketing. She recalled, however, that one early morning, she and Richard saw KATHERINE in the company of a man in his early twenties. When KATHERINE did not return from her early morning jog, they even had to look for her. [20] Further bolstering FELIZARDO's defense as well as Herminia's testimony, Richard Jude Gonzales, KATHERINE's brother, testified that he did not notice anything unusual in their house on 15 August 1997. After this case was filed, KATHERINE apparently revealed to him that she was actually raped by a certain Eric and not by their uncle FELIZARDO. [21] Finally, the defense called on KATHERINE as a recanting witness. She declared that she had not been raped by her uncle FELIZARDO but by a certain Eric, a transient in their place. Sometime in the early morning of June or July, 1995, Eric befriended her while she was jogging. A week later, Eric raped her, first at the fishpond across the river of Magsungay, and again, after a week, at a camote plantation. [22] She did not report the incident for fear that she might be harmed by her relatives. To ensure her physical well-being, she decided to put the blame on her uncle FELIZARDO. [23] In its decision [24] the trial court gave more weight and credence to the prosecution's evidence and convicted FELIZARDO despite KATHERINE's recantation. Thus: The evidence more than sufficiently proved that the accused, by means of intimidation, have [sic] sexual intercourse, with KATHERINE Gonzales, his niece[,] under the circumstances as charged in the Information. The guilt of the accused having been proved beyond reasonable doubt, the court declares him GUILTY and imposes on him the penalty of DEATH. The recantation of the offended party is equivalent to a waiver of her claim of [sic] civil indemnification. Accordingly, the Court makes no pronouncement with respect to the civil liability of the accused. [25] As stated at the outset, in view of the penalty imposed, the case was brought to this Court for automatic review pursuant to Article 47 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 22 of Republic Act No. 7659. In his Appellant's Brief, FELIZARDO posits this single assignment of error: THE TRIAL COURT ERRED IN NOT FINDING THAT THE TESTIMONY OF PRIVATE COMPLAINANT WAS PUNCTURED WITH MATERIAL IMPROBABILITIES THEREBY CASTING GRAVE DOUBTS ON THE CRIMINAL CULPABILITY OF THE ACCUSED-APPELLANT. In support of the assigned error FELIZARDO first harps on the fact that, as testified by KATHERINE, she was violated \"inside a one-room affair, 5 x 6 meters wide,\" on an old matrimonial bed where she, her grandmother Herminia, and her cousin Joan slept. Two of her four brothers slept on one side of the bed, while the other two slept with FELIZARDO on the other side of the same bed. FELIZARDO also questions the alleged delay in the reporting of the rape, and relies heavily on the recantation of KATHERINE buttressed by the testimony of Herminia and Richard. Finally, FELIZARDO cites the absence of intimidation or physical struggle or resistance to signify KATHERINE's vehement and utmost refusal. Thus, without in the least admitting that sexual liaison took place, it could be said that whatever happened between them was done through mutual consent. We are not persuaded by FELIZARDO's arguments. It is well settled that when a woman says that she has been raped, she says in, effect, all that is necessary to show that she has indeed been raped. [26] A victim of rape would not come out in the open if her motive were anything other than to obtain justice. Her testimony as to who abused her is credible where she has absolutely no motive to incriminate and testify against the accused. [27] A lass of tender age would not concoct a tale of defloration unless she, in fact, had been raped, for it would be instinctive for her to protect her honor. [28] In the instant case, there is absolutely no showing that KATHERINE was actuated by any sinister motive to falsely charge her own uncle with such a serious crime. If she admitted the ignominy she had undergone, allowed her private parts to be examined, exposed herself to the trouble and inconvenience of a public trial, and endured the embarrassment and humiliation attached to the revelation of that which ought to be suffered in silence, we are convinced that she had nothing in mind except to obtain justice. [29] Neither is this Court convinced with FELIZARDO's argument that it is physically impossible to commit the rape in such a small room where KATHERINE's four brothers also slept. We have long adhered to the rule that it is not necessary for the rape to be committed in an isolated place, for rapists bear no respect for locale and time when they carry out their evil deed. [30] In fact, it can be committed in places were people congregate, in parks, along the roadside, within school premises, inside an occupied house, and even in the room where other members of the family are also sleeping. [31] Thus, it is not totally impossible for FELIZARDO to have raped KATHERINE even when the other members of the household were present. Again, there is no rule to the effect that a woman can only be raped in seclusion. [32] Anent the silence of KATHERINE for ten months, we have held time and again that the silence of the offended party in a case of rape, or her failure to disclose her defilement without loss of time to persons close to her and to report the matter to the authorities, would not perforce warrant a conclusion that she was not sexually molested and that her charges against the accused are all baseless, untrue or fabricated. Other relevant facts and circumstances must be considered. In this case, KATHERINE kept silent about the incident because of FELIZARDO's threat to kill her brothers. Moreover, she continued to live in the same house with FELIZARDO. KATHERINE cannot then be blamed for her seeming vacillation, for the initial reluctance of a rape victim to come forward and report that she had been, sexually abused is itself a natural reaction. Nothing less can be expected from a victim of such a tender age. [33] This is especially true in this case, where the malefactor is the victim's uncle. [34] As observed by the trial court: The accused is the uncle of Katherine and they lived in the same house and occupy the same room. Since Katherine's parents are not in the house, the father is in prison while the mother is abroad, it is without doubt that the accused exercised moral ascendancy and influence over his 12-year old niece. In rape committed by a close kin, moral ascendancy substitutes for violence and intimidation. [35] Neither can FELIZARDO be allowed to make much of the fact that the recantation of KATHERINE should have earned him an acquittal. We have said in so many cases that retractions are generally unreliable and are looked upon with considerable disfavor by the courts. [36] Like any other testimony, it is subject to the test of credibility based on the relevant circumstances and, especially, on the demeanor of the witness on the stand. [37] In this case, it is quite incredible that, after going through the process of having FELIZARDO arrested by the police, positively identifying him as the person who raped her, enduring the humiliation of physical examination of her private parts, and then repeating her accusations in open court by recounting her anguish, KATHERINE would suddenly turn around and declare that \"after a careful deliberation of the case she now realizes that her conscience would not permit her to send an innocent man to jail.\" As we observed in People v. Ulbina : [38] xxx Similarly, it would be a dangerous rule for courts to reject testimonies solemnly taken before courts of justice simply because the witnesses who had given them later on change(d) their mind for one reason or another, for such rule would make solemn trials a mockery and place the investigation of truth at the mercy of unscrupulous witnesses. x x x The rule should be that a testimony solemnly given in court should not be lightly set aside and that before this can be done, both the previous testimony and the subsequent one be carefully compared, the circumstances under which each given carefully scrutinized, the reasons or motives for the change carefully scrutinized--in other words, all the expedients devised by man to determine the credibility of witnesses should be utilized to determine which of the contradictory testimonies represents the truth. In this case, the trial court described KATHERINE's testimony for the defense as nothing more than a rehearsed testimony. The trial court stated that: The testimony of Katherine when she testified as the complainant, is forthright and honest. It is very credible and should be given weight. There is no indication whatsoever that her declaration was contrived, coached or stage-managed. Moreover, there is absolutely no reason why she should charge her own uncle of a heinous crime if such is not the truth. x x x When Katherine took the witness stand as a defense witness and recanted her first testimony, it was an entirely different story. This time her testimony was loose and vague. This time the Court could readily discern that her testimony was contrived. She would answer spontaneously anticipated questions but those which appears unexpected, she was hesitant and evasive. There is no doubt at all in the mind of the Court that the young girl was pressured into changing her testimony to save her uncle. [39] (Italics supplied) Furthermore, as consistently held by this Court, when the issue is one of credibility of witnesses, appellate courts will generally not disturb the findings of the trial court, considering that the latter is in a better position to decide the question, having heard the witnesses themselves and observed their deportment and manner of testifying during trial, unless it has plainly overlooked certain facts of substance and value that, if considered, might affect the result of the case. [40] As to intimidation, the evidence discloses that FELIZARDO forced KATHERINE to lie on the bed and removed her shorts and panty against her will; and when she struggled to free herself and to shout for help, he covered and squeezed her mouth and threatened to kill her and her brothers. We are convinced with moral certainty that FELIZARDO raped KATHERINE on 15 August 1997. The penalty therefor is death because KATHERINE was less than 18 years at the time of its commission and FELIZARDO is her uncle, a relative by consanguinity within the third civil degree. A niece is defined as the female child of a brother or sister, [41] or the daughter of one's brother or sister, or of one's brother in law or sister in law. [42] Under Article 335 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 11 of R.A. No. 7659, the death penalty shall be imposed if the victim is under eighteen (18) years old and its offender is, among others, a relative by consanguinity or affinity within the third civil degree. Four members of the Court maintain their position that R.A. No. 7659, insofar as it prescribes the death penalty, is unconstitutional; nevertheless, they submit to the ruling of the Court by majority vote, that the law itself is constitutional and the death penalty should be accordingly imposed. The Court notes, however, that the trial court made no pronouncement as to FELIZARDO's civil liability on the ground that KATHERINE recanted her testimony. This was erroneous. Notwithstanding her recantation, KATHERINE is by law entitled to an award of indemnity, which current jurisprudence fixes at P75,000, [43] as well as to moral and exemplary damages. Moral damages are imposed in rape cases involving young girls between thirteen (13) and nineteen (19) years of age, taking into account the immeasurable havoc wrought on their youthful feminine psyche. [44] It is also settled that moral damages should be automatically awarded in rape cases without need of proof, for it is assumed that the complainant has suffered moral injuries entitling her to such an award. [45] Thus, the award of P50,000 as moral damages is in order without any proof of its basis. Lastly, exemplary damages in the amount of P50,000 is likewise imposed upon FELIZARDO, not to punish him or to enrich KATHERINE, but to serve as a deterrent against or as a negative incentive to curb socially deleterious actions.” [46] WHEREFORE , the decision of 3 March 1998 of the Regional Trial Court of Bacolod City, Branch 50, in Criminal Case No. 97-18570, finding accused-appellant FELIZARDO GONZALES y ALTARES guilty beyond reasonable doubt of the crime of rape and sentencing him to suffer the supreme penalty of DEATH, is hereby AFFIRMED with the modification that accused-appellant is ordered to pay the offended party, Katherine M. Gonzales, the amounts of P75,000 as civil indemnity, P50,000 as moral damages, and P50,000 as exemplary damages. In accordance with Article 83 of the Revised Penal Code, as amended by Section 25 of Republic Act No. 7659, upon finality of this decision, let the records of this case be forwarded to the Office of the President for possible exercise of pardoning power. No pronouncement as to costs. SO ORDERED .
